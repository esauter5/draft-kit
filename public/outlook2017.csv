Name,Outlook
Le'Veon Bell,"Bell was suspended for four games to start the 2016 season but still managed to finish fifth at the position in rushing yards, as well as second in targets, receptions and receiving yards. Bell has been on the field for at least 86 percent of the team's offensive snaps during 25 consecutive games in which he wasn't injured or limited (25 of his past 28 total). During those 25 games, he was on the field for 95 percent of the snaps and handled 22.2 carries and 6.7 targets per game. The heavy usage allowed him a top-14 fantasy week during all 12 of his outings last season. There's little reason to expect the 25-year-old to play a reduced role in 2017. His off-field antics are a concern, but Bell is too good to pass on early in the first round of your draft."
David Johnson,"Johnson's breakout 2016 campaign was the highlight of a comeback year at the running back position. Fantasy's top-scoring running back accrued 2,118 yards and 20 touchdowns on 373 touches. Johnson paced all backs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and end-zone targets (four). He carried the ball inside the opponent's 5-yard line 22 times (second most). Johnson's pedestrian rushing efficiency (4.2 YPC, including 1.6 after contact) is far from ideal, but he more than made up for it with volume; Johnson registered a top-10 fantasy week during a position-best 75 percent of his outings. Johnson is in his prime at age 25 and positioned well to again see 22-24 touches every week."
Antonio Brown,"How high were expectations for Brown last season? His 106-catch, 1,284-yard, 12-touchdown season was widely regarded as a letdown. Brown missed a game, but still topped wide receivers in fantasy points for the third consecutive season. He finished top-five in targets, receptions and receiving yards for the fourth straight year. Brown turns 29 this year, so he still figures to have a few years of top-end production left in the tank. Ben Roethlisberger's top target and fantasy's most consistently dominant wide receiver should be off the board early in the first round of your draft."
Odell Beckham Jr.,"Beckham's 2016 season started slowly, but he ended up posting career bests in both targets (167) and receptions (101). Beckham has now managed at least 91 receptions, 1,305 yards and 10 touchdowns during each of his first three pro seasons. He's finished as a top-seven fantasy wide receiver each of those years. Beckham is known more for his highlight reel catches, but he also ranked seventh in the NFL with 15 end zone targets last season (up from 11 in 2015). The 24-year-old superstar is just getting started and should only benefit from New York's offseason addition of Brandon Marshall and first-round pick Evan Engram. Beckham is a low-risk, high-ceiling pick early in the first round of fantasy drafts."
Julio Jones,"Jones missed two games with a toe injury, but still managed to finish sixth among wide receivers in fantasy points last season. Jones' target share dipped a bit, but Matt Ryan's top target thrived in the breakout offense of the year. Despite eclipsing eight touchdowns in a season just once in his career, Jones has finished as a top-11 fantasy receiver during four of the past five seasons. Durability continues to be an issue for Jones, as he's missed at least one game during four of his six NFL seasons. The Atlanta offense will surely come back to earth a bit this season, but 28-year-old Jones is arguably the game's best talent at the position. Select him in the middle of the first round."
Mike Evans,"Evans was terrific during his first two years in the NFL, but he took his game to a new level in 2016. Evans paced the NFL with 170 targets, a league-high 20 of which came in the end zone, and ranked top-six in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. A 6-foot-5 downfield weapon, Evans has ranked top-10 at the position in average depth of target each of his first three seasons in the NFL, which justifies his substandard 54 percent catch rate. Fantasy's No. 4-scoring wideout was consistent but not dominant, posting only four top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied for ninth. The additions of DeSean Jackson and O.J. Howard will take some heat off of Evans and won't cost him many targets and scoring opportunities. Evans is a solid WR1."
LeSean McCoy,"McCoy turns 29 this summer, but his age and hefty career volume of work didn't seem to slow him in 2016. Far from it, in fact. McCoy ranked in the top six in rushing yards for the fourth time in six years and, thanks in part to elite run blocking, his 5.4 YPC ranked fifth among backs. McCoy posted a top-10 fantasy week during 53 percent of his 15 outings (sixth best) and finished fourth at the position in fantasy points. McCoy also caught an incredible 50 of 55 targets (91 percent). Buffalo won't be quite as run heavy with Rex Ryan gone, but McCoy is an explosive lead back in an offense that ranked seventh in touchdowns per game last year. He's a quality RB1 option."
Jordy Nelson,"Considering that he missed his entire age-30 season with a torn ACL, it was fair to wonder just how effective Nelson would be in 2016. It turns out the answer was 'very,' as Nelson caught 97 passes for 1,257 yards and 14 touchdowns en route to finishing second among wide receivers in fantasy points. Nelson's seven top-10 fantasy weeks were second-most at the position and he finished 35th or better during all but two of his 16 outings. Nelson has finished second, third, 13th and fourth during the past four seasons in which he's appeared in all 16 games. He scored 13-plus touchdowns during three of those campaigns. Nelson's age (32) is enough to knock him down a few spots, but he's still a quality target near the first/second-round turn."
A.J. Green,"The Bengals' 2016 season was marred by injuries and Green was caught up in the onslaught. After posting at least 1,000 receiving yards during his first six seasons, Green caught 66 passes for 964 yards and four scores in 10 games in 2016. He finished an NFL-best 70 percent of his 10 starts as a top-30 non-PPR fantasy receiver. He's finished top-nine at the position in PPR during three of the past five seasons, but has missed a total of nine games due to injury over the past three seasons. Green turns 29 years old this year and remains one of the best and most heavily targeted wideouts in the league."
Devonta Freeman,"Freeman registered 57 fewer touches in 2016 than he did when he led all running backs in fantasy points in 2015, but the dynamic young back produced only 32 fewer fantasy points. Freeman posted a healthy 4.8 YPC, thanks, in part, to terrific blocking (3.2 yards before contact per attempt ranked seventh) and high-value carries (his 16 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line ranked fifth). Freeman ranked ninth in rushing yards and fifth in receiving yards at the position. He posted seven top-10 fantasy weeks. The presence of Tevin Coleman, departure of Kyle Shanahan and some offensive regression to the mean will lead to a statistical step back for Freeman, but he's still a back-end RB1 option in all formats."
Michael Thomas,"Thomas was fantasy's No. 7 wide receiver despite missing one game as a rookie. The Ohio State product caught 77 percent of his targets (third best among wideouts) and averaged 9.5 yards per target (ninth). He posted an impressive nine top-30 fantasy weeks during his final 13 games of the season. New Orleans' second-round pick from 2016 is obviously in the WR1 mix, especially with Brandin Cooks gone, but keep in mind that a Saints wide receiver has exceeded a 20 percent target share only once during the Sean Payton/Drew Brees era (Thomas averaged a 20 percent share as a rookie). Nonetheless, Brees will back under center in 2017, so the 24-year-old Thomas is a great bet for a huge second season."
Melvin Gordon,"Gordon enjoyed a breakout 2016 season, but it would've been even better if not for a season-ending hip injury suffered in Week 14. Gordon entered that game with 12 touchdowns and third at the position in fantasy points. Gordon was limited to 3.9 YPC on the season but was good after contact (his 2.0 YAC ranked 16th). Gordon registered 17 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (third most) and his 419 receiving yards ranked ninth. Gordon is entering his prime years at age 24 and will again be the clear feature back for an emerging Los Angeles franchise. Select him in the second round of your draft."
Jordan Howard,"Howard opened his rookie season third on Chicago's depth chart, but it didn't take the intriguing fifth-round pick long to work his way into workhorse duties. The big man ranked 11th in the league in carries, but his terrific effectiveness (5.2 YPC, 2.2 YAC) allowed him the second-most rushing yards. Howard's hands (position-high eight drops) are a concern, but he still managed 48 targets and averaged a healthy 10.3 yards per reception. Touchdowns may elude Howard in Chicago's underwhelming offense, but the 22-year-old emerging star will push for 20 touches every week. Upgrade him slightly in non-PPR."
T.Y. Hilton,"Following four years as essentially a solid No. 2 fantasy receiver, Hilton took his game to a new level in 2016. The 5-foot-9, 180-pound playmaker caught 91 of 153 targets for 1,448 yards, all of which were career highs. Hilton averaged 9.5 yards per target (10th best) and finished as a top-10 fantasy receiver during 38 percent of his outings (sixth best). Hilton isn't a great source of touchdowns, averaging exactly six per season since entering the league, but he makes up for it with heavy volume and high-end efficiency in the Colts' pass-heavy, Andrew Luck-led offense."
DeMarco Murray,"Following a rough year in Philadelphia, Murray reassumed his spot as one of the game's top tailbacks with 1,664 yards from scrimmage in Tennessee last year. Murray averaged a healthy 4.4 yards per carry despite facing an average of 8.1 in-box defenders (fourth highest). Murray ranked third at the position in carries and sixth in receptions, which helped him to his third top-six fantasy season in four years. Once labeled as injury prone, Murray has missed one game in the past three seasons. Murray is now 29, and Derrick Henry's role only figures to expand, but the veteran remains the lead back and a three-down contributor in one of the game's most run-heavy offenses."
Jay Ajayi,"Ajayi wasn't pleased about losing Miami's starting gig to Arian Foster last preseason. He may have had a point. After sitting out Week 1, Ajayi rolled to 1,423 yards and 8 touchdowns on 287 touches. He posted a 4.9 YPC (11th best), including 2.5 yards after contact (fifth). Although Ajayi was extremely effective, a hefty chunk of his fantasy production came in three games. He posted a top-three point total in each of those games, which accounted for half of his six top-20 fantasy weeks. Ajayi doesn't add much as a receiver, but he's now the clear feature back in Miami's run-first offense. The 24-year-old should be off the board during the second round of your draft."
Doug Baldwin,"Regression to the mean was an inevitability for Seattle's top wideout last season and, although his touchdown production was cut in half, Baldwin still managed his second consecutive top-10 fantasy campaign. Baldwin posted career highs in receptions and yardage on his way to an eighth-place finish. For the second straight season, he was a bit too boom/bust, posting five top-10 weeks, but only three additional top-30 finishes. Baldwin is in his prime years at age 28 and remains one of the games' most-underrated players. He's a solid WR2 play in a Seattle offense that has relied more on the pass in recent years."
Dez Bryant,"Injuries have limited Bryant to 22 games during the past two regular seasons, so it's easy to forget that he finished as a top-seven fantasy receiver during the prior three seasons. He was pretty good during the 13 games he played last season as well, posting a top-20 fantasy week during 54 percent of his outings (seventh best). Bryant scored eight touchdowns in 2016 after averaging 13.7 per season from 2012 to 2014. Bryant is averaging 8.8 targets per game (27 percent target share) during the 53 games he's played at least three-quarters of the pass play snaps since the start of 2013. The 28-year-old's volume will be limited some by Dallas' run-heavy scheme, but he does enough damage to warrant second-round consideration."
Leonard Fournette,"The Jaguars selected Fournette with the fourth overall pick in April's draft. He immediately steps in as the team's feature back. In terms of running backs with elite athleticism, size and upside as a ball carrier, you'll struggle to find a prospect more intriguing than Fournette. The LSU product is 6-foot-0, 240 pounds with big hands, long arms and 4.51 wheels. Fournette was dominant during his freshman and sophomore seasons, but an ankle injury limited his effectiveness during seven games last season. Fournette's receiving and blocking inadequacies may limit his rookie-season contributions slightly, but the 22-year-old's clear path to carries and elite upside as a rusher positions him as a strong RB2."
Todd Gurley,"Gurley's 2016 season was a disaster. He ranked fifth in carries and 12th in targets among running backs, but finished 15th at the position in fantasy points. Gurley failed to finish a single week better than 10th. His YPC fell from 4.8 in 2015 to 3.2 last season. Gurley faced an average of 7.6 in-box defenders, which is near league average, but his line struggled to create open lanes (1.6 yards before contact per attempt was seventh lowest). Gurley was quietly pretty busy as a receiver, handling 57 targets (12th most among backs). Gurley is only 22 and a strong candidate for a bounce-back season, but he will struggle to find running lanes and scoring opportunities if second-year QB Jared Goff fails to improve on a brutal rookie showing."
Amari Cooper,"Cooper already has a pair of 1,000-yard seasons under his belt, which is pretty incredible when you realize that he achieved that prior to turning 23 years old. Cooper took a step forward in his second season, cutting his drops from 10 to four, improving his yards per target from 8.6 to 8.9 and jumping from 21st to 13th at the position in fantasy points. Cooper will need to find paydirt more often in order to join the fantasy elite -- he has just 11 scores in two seasons -- but the former fourth-overall pick is just scratching the surface of his upside. He's a strong candidate for another big leap in 2017."
Demaryius Thomas,"Thomas finished 16th among wide receivers in fantasy points last season and was 11th in 2015. That's not too bad, but he's trending in the wrong direction after finishing in the top six each of the previous three seasons. Amazingly, Thomas has posted a grand total of two top-10 fantasy weeks over the past two seasons. He caught 90 passes for 1,083 yards and five touchdowns and racked up eight end zone targets last season, all of which were his lowest totals since 2011. Thomas is still in his prime at age 29, but Denver's shaky quarterback situation has dropped him to high-floor WR2 status."
Brandin Cooks,"Cooks -- a first-round pick back in 2014 -- has three NFL seasons under his belt, but incredibly is only 23 years old. He adds an every-down speed component to a Patriots offense that has relied heavily on short and intermediate passing in recent years. Cooks joins New England having posted back-to-back 1,100-yard receiving seasons, including a total of 17 touchdowns during the two campaigns. He was fantasy's No. 13 wide receiver in 2015 and improved to 10th last season. Cooks needs to be downgraded in New England's crowded offense and he moves from the Superdome to icy New England (he's yet to play in an NFL game at a temperature below 55 degrees), but he's one of the game's top lid-lifters in one of the game's best offenses. He's a WR2 target with big upside."
Rob Gronkowski,"Gronkowski is one of the most dominant players in the NFL, but injuries continue to derail his career. The three-time top fantasy tight end has missed at least one game during each of the past five years, a total of 24 during the span. Gronkowski appeared in eight games last season, and led all tight ends in fantasy points during Weeks 6-10. He's finished in the top five in touchdowns, fantasy points and yards per target during the past four seasons in which he's appeared in at least 11 games. Gronkowski turns 28 this year and is expected to be back to full health, so although his durability is a major concern, his dominant production makes him worth consideration during the second round of your draft."
Lamar Miller,"Needless to say, Miller's first season in Houston was a disappointment. After averaging 4.6 YPC during four seasons in Miami, Miller failed to erase concerns that he couldn't handle a bigger role by averaging 4.0 YPC in 2016. He averaged 1.3 yards after contact, which was third worst in the NFL. Miller averaged nearly 20 carries per game but played a minimal role on passing downs and managed only 6.4 YPR. Miller is still only 26 years old and remains clearly atop the depth chart, but it's safe to assume he'll defer snaps and carries to third-round pick D'Onta Foreman this season."
DeAndre Hopkins,"The disaster that was the Brock Osweiler season in Houston had a fairly sizable effect on Hopkins' numbers last season. One year after finishing as fantasy's No. 4 wide receiver, Hopkins' targets fell by 44, his receptions by 33, his receiving yards by 567 and his touchdowns by seven. He managed two top-10 fantasy weeks and 26 receivers scored more fantasy points. Osweiler is gone, but Houston's quarterback situation remains shaky, at best. Nonetheless, Hopkins is a bounce-back candidate on the grounds that he's in his prime at age 25 and one of the game's most talented players."
Ezekiel Elliott,"Elliott paced the NFL with 322 carries and 1,631 rushing yards while finding the end zone a total of 16 times last season. Not bad for a rookie. Elliott faced an average of 8.0 in-box defenders, which was fifth highest in the NFL. The 2016 fourth overall pick trailed only David Johnson in fantasy points despite being limited to 38 targets (33rd). Elliott's rushing prowess, combined with Dallas' terrific offensive line and run-heavy scheme, will keep him near the top of the running back rankings on a per-game basis, but he's in for some regression to the mean in the scoring department (only 11 carries inside the 5-yard line). Elliott also will need more receiving work to maximize his fantasy contributions, which is likely, following the departure of Lance Dunbar. Elliott is suspended for six games (appeal pending), so he's best viewed as a third-round target. He'll be an elite RB1 upon his return in Week 8."
Terrelle Pryor Sr.,"Pryor spent the first four years of his pro career as a quarterback, but has made an impressive transition to wide receiver over the past two seasons. Last season marked Pryor's first as an every-down receiver and he wasn't short on volume. Pryor racked up 135 targets (13th most), including 14 while in the end zone (ninth), and was an average of 13.9 yards down field when targeted (11th highest). Despite the fact 26.7 percent of balls thrown his way were off target, Pryor finished as fantasy's No. 20 receiver. Pryor is in his prime at age 27 and, at 6-foot-4 and 223 pounds, he adds some serious size to the perimeter in Washington. Pryor will be heavily targeted and should easily improve in the touchdown department in a better offense."
Isaiah Crowell,"Crowell barely managed top-35 fantasy campaigns during his first two professional seasons but increased efficiency and a larger passing-game role helped him leap to a 14th-place finish last year. Crowell was a bit reliant on a handful of big plays but still managed a 4.8 YPC (15th) on 198 carries. He continues to struggle after initial contact -- since he entered the league, his 1.47 YAC is worst in the league among backs with at least 300 carries -- and was helped by 3.3 yards before contact last year (third highest). He doubled his previous career total with 40 receptions, but he'll still play second fiddle to impressive third-year back Duke Johnson Jr. in that department."
Alshon Jeffery,"Jeffery heads to Philadelphia on a one-year deal after spending the first five years of his career in Chicago. The 2012 second-round pick has missed quite a bit of time during his career, but his durability woes are probably a bit overstated; he's missed a total of seven games due to injury the past four years. Jeffery has been a super-productive and heavily utilized target when healthy. During those past four years, he's averaging 9.0 targets per game. His average of 16.0 fantasy points per game in PPR play during that span would've ranked ninth at the position last season. He sits third in the entire NFL in end zone targets during the past four years (63). Jeffery is in his prime at age 27 and will be a workhorse as Carson Wentz's top target."
Keenan Allen,"Now four years into his NFL career, Allen has been a heavily utilized and terrific fantasy asset when active, but he's now missed 23 games due to injury over the past two years. Allen has yet to appear in 16 games in a single season. The former second-round pick is averaging 8.5 targets per game (24 percent share) during the 36 games of his career in which he's played at least two-thirds of the Chargers' pass play snaps. He might not be able to hit that mark this year with the Chargers' receiving arsenal suddenly pretty stacked. Considering he's primarily used in the short area, the projected dip in usage and his durability woes knock him into WR3 territory (fringe WR2 in PPR)."
Michael Crabtree,"Who led the Raiders in targets and receiving touchdowns each of the past two years? If you guessed Amari Cooper, you guessed wrong. Crabtree has been the team's top wideout both seasons, posting strikingly similar stat lines both years. Crabtree's high floor has been his best asset, as he finished as a top-40 fantasy wideout during 10 of his final 11 games in 2015 and top-30 in 63 percent of his 2016 appearances (sixth best). Crabtree has struggled with drops (nine last season) and doesn't add much after the catch (3.1 RAC), but he sees a ton of high-value targets (he's ranked top-10 in end zone targets among wide receivers each of the past two years) in a good offense. The 29-year-old is a solid WR2."
Marshawn Lynch,"Lynch ended his retirement after one season and will return to the league as Oakland's feature back. The Oakland native is now 31 years old, hasn't played football since struggling to a 3.8 YPC during an injury-plagued 2015 season. Still, it's hard to doubt a player who racked up 6,347 yards and 57 touchdowns on 1,457 carries (4.4 YPC) during his six seasons in Seattle. A staple the near the goal line, Lynch paces the NFL with 100 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line over the past decade. The Raiders' offensive line is among the league's best, which will surely help Lynch's effectiveness. He's a candidate for double-digit touchdowns and a fine RB2 target."
Golden Tate,"Tate has been on the field for at least 87 percent of his team's snaps in four consecutive seasons (one with Seattle, three with Detroit), and he's averaging 7.6 targets and 0.4 carries per game during that span. Last season, Tate ranked 17th among wide receivers in fantasy points, including seventh after Week 5. He's one of four NFL players who have caught 90-plus passes each of the past three seasons. He doesn't score many touchdowns (14 total in three seasons with Detroit), but did show some upside by posting a top-10 fantasy week in 31 percent of his outings last year (seventh-best). The 29-year-old is an underrated WR2 who belongs in the WR3 mix in non-PPR."
Carlos Hyde,"Hyde can't seem to stay on the field (14 missed games in three seasons), but he has been extremely effective when healthy. Hyde averaged a career-best 4.6 YPC on 217 carries last season and has ranked top 10 in the NFL in YAC each of the past two years. Hyde finished 2016 ranked 18th in fantasy points in only 13 games, posting five top-10 weeks. He was powered by nine touchdowns, although he's unlikely to repeat his three receiving scores with such a limited passing-down role."
Danny Woodhead,"Woodhead missed most of last season with a torn ACL and joins the Ravens at 32 years old. Considering his age, injury woes and new home, Woodhead's effectiveness and role are tough to predict, but it's hard to imagine him coming anywhere close to the 78.5 receptions he averaged during his two full seasons in San Diego. Still, Woodhead will surely slide in as the passing-down specialist, with Terrance West dominating early downs. Consider him an RB2 option and downgrade him in non-PPR."
Ty Montgomery,"Green Bay's third-round pick in 2015, Montgomery converted to running back during the 2016 season, which seems like a smart move, considering his level of success. He impressed by averaging 5.9 YPC and 3.3 yards after contact, both of which were tops in the NFL. Montgomery is unlikely to emerge as a workhorse, especially after the team selected tailbacks Jamaal Williams, Aaron Jones and Devante Mays in April's draft, but his strong play suggests he'll at least remain busy as part of a committee. He's a fine flex target."
Larry Fitzgerald,"Fitzgerald's career is winding down, but it's safe to say his projected demise has been greatly exaggerated. The 33-year-old future Hall of Famer paced the NFL with 107 receptions last season and finished as a top-11 fantasy wideout for the seventh time in 10 years. Fitzgerald primarily works in the short area from the slot, which is reflected in his 9.6 yards per catch(fifth lowest) last season. Hot starts and slow finishes have been a problem for Fitzgerald. Over the past two seasons, he's first in fantasy points during Weeks 1-5 and 33rd from Week 14 on. Fitzgerald will again be a key target in an Arizona offense that quietly ranked sixth in touchdowns last season. He's a WR2 and should be downgraded in non-PPR."
Jordan Reed,"Reed has posted a pair of top-10 fantasy seasons in the past two seasons, which is impressive when you consider he missed six games during the span. In fact, he's never appeared in more than 14 games in a single season. Reed handled 8.3 targets per game during 38 career games in which he was on the field for more than half of the Redskins' offensive plays. The mark is 8.8 if we limit the sample to the past two seasons (24 games). Incredibly, Reed has caught at least three-quarters of his targets during each of his four NFL seasons. Reed's injury woes are a pain, but he's a heavily utilized and elite fantasy tight end when active."
Bilal Powell,"Powell spent most of the 2016 season as a passing-down specialist behind Matt Forte, but he exploded down the stretch. In the final four weeks of the season, Powell averaged 20.5 carries and 5.8 targets per game. He racked up 552 yards and three scores and trailed only Le'Veon Bell in fantasy points in that span. Powell averaged 5.5 YPC (fifth), including 2.2 after contact (eighth). He quietly ranks sixth among backs with 105 receptions over the past two seasons. Forte remains in the mix, but Powell, 28, is the better bet to lead the Jets' backfield in touches this season. "
Christian McCaffrey,"McCaffrey enters the NFL with a ton of pedigree following an absurdly productive and highly publicized collegiate career. The 20-year-old has sufficient size (5-foot-11, 202 pounds) and speed, but truly makes hay with extraordinary elusiveness and vision. McCaffrey converted nearly three-quarters of his third-down carries and only 10 percent of his 253 attempts went for negative yards last season. McCaffrey is also a strong receiver and returner and can block. He killed it at the combine, posting a 4.48 40-yard dash while also dominating the vertical jump, three-cone, short shuttle and 60-yard shuttle. The seventh overall pick in April's draft immediately steps into a significant role in Carolina. He will surely defer some carries and goal-line work to Jonathan Stewart, but McCaffrey's versatility will allow him enough work to provide RB2 production."
Aaron Rodgers,"Fantasy's reigning top-scoring quarterback is coming off a season in which he threw for 4,428 yards, ran for a career-high 369 yards and had a hand in 44 touchdowns. Rodgers finished in the top five of the league in pass attempts, completions, passing yards and touchdowns. The Packers won't be as obscenely reliant on the pass in 2017, but this remains a pass-first offense that added Martellus Bennett to a unit that also includes Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams. Rodgers has finished as a top-two fantasy quarterback during seven of the past nine seasons and is the best bet to top the charts in 2017."
Tom Brady,"Brady was suspended for the first four games of last season, but he still managed to toss 28 touchdowns, which was seventh most in the league. Brady was absolutely dominant upon his return, ranking fifth in completion percentage (67 percent) and second in yards per attempt (8.2), while throwing only two interceptions. He posted a top-10 fantasy week during 58 percent of his outings and has ranked top-five in that category during five of the past seven years. The return of Rob Gronkowski and the team's addition of Brandin Cooks only add to Brady's appeal during his age-40 season."
Jarvis Landry,"Landry enters his fourth NFL season as one of the game's most reliable short-area/slot targets, but his role has grossly capped his fantasy upside. Landry ranks fourth in the NFL in receptions but 58th in touchdown catches since entering the league. Incredibly, Landry was afforded only one end zone target last season, which was down sharply from his total of nine in 2015. Still, he finished as a top-10 fantasy receiver in 31 percent of his appearances (seventh best). The Dolphins' top target will continue to dominate with the ball in his hands (his 6.8 RAC was third-best among wideouts last year) and makes for a quality WR2. Downgrade him in non-PPR."
Davante Adams,"This time last year, it was fair to wonder if Adams was a bust, following an injury-plagued and underwhelming 2015 in which he barely caught half of the balls thrown his way and averaged a horrific 5.4 yards per target (second worst). A healthy Adams changed the conversation pretty quickly by exploding into fantasy's ninth-highest-scoring wideout in his third pro season. Adams absolutely benefited from Aaron Rodgers and the Packers' pass-heavy, high-volume offense; his 16 end zone targets were fifth-most and helped him to 12 touchdowns (second most). Adams, who ranked 22nd at the position in targets, is a near-lock for touchdown regression to the mean, but he's only 24 years old and an every-down player in one of the game's best pass offenses."
Travis Kelce,"Kelce took his game to yet another level last season and ended up as fantasy's top-scoring tight end. That came after top-eight finishes during his first two full years in the league. Interestingly, when you compare 2015 to 2016, Kelce was actually on the field less last season, saw a slight dip in target share and scored one fewer touchdown. On the other hand, his catch rate (71 to 74 percent), average depth of target (5.5 to 6.7) and yards per target (8.7 to 9.8) increased, and he continued his post-catch domination. Kelce is a quality TE1, but lacks the upside of Rob Gronkowski and Jordan Reed."
Dalvin Cook,"The Vikings selected Cook in the second round of April's draft. The Florida State product supplies the team with an explosive and elusive back who is dominant after initial contact (2.6 YAC in 2016) and big enough to work at the goal line. Cook has the size and receiving ability to contribute on all three downs at the pro level. There are many red flags with Cook, including drops, fumbles, negative runs, an unimpressive combine and a handful of off-the-field incidents. At the end of the day, the 21-year-old is a potentially elite playmaker who can check boxes in the volume, scoring and receiving departments. He may start slowly, but it won't take him long to secure feature back duties ahead of Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon."
Emmanuel Sanders,"Sanders spent the first four seasons of his career as a secondary target in Pittsburgh, but he's grown into a star in Denver. His statistics have trended downward each of his three years with the team, but he's still managed to finish a season no worse than 21st among wide receivers in fantasy points. A whopping 29 percent of balls thrown to Sanders were off target last season (third highest), but he dropped only one of 136 targets and eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for the third year in a row. Sanders handled a career-high 14 end zone targets last season (ninth most). Sanders is positioned well to finish top-15 at the position in targets for the fourth straight season, but his upside will be limited by Denver's weak quarterback situation."
Julian Edelman,"Despite finishing no lower than seventh among wide receivers in receptions during three of the past four years, Edelman has never finished a season better than 14th in fantasy points. Last year, Edelman ranked third in targets and second in catches, but found the end zone only three times. He led the NFL with 10 drops for the second time in three years and, despite catching 98 passes, he finished outside the top-20 receivers during 81 percent of his outings. A whopping 51 wide receivers had a better rate. Edelman is entering his age-31 season and his target share is sure to dip with Rob Gronkowski healthy and Brandin Cooks in the mix, but he remains Tom Brady's go-to short-area target. He's a fringe WR2 who should be downgraded in non-PPR."
Greg Olsen,"Olsen scored a touchdown on only three of his 80 receptions, but still managed to finish a career-best third in fantasy points among tight ends last season. Olsen has now finished top-seven at the position in targets, completions and receiving yards each of the past five years. His touchdown total was his lowest since 2007 despite reaching 10 end zone targets for the third time in four years. Olsen works downfield more than most tight ends; he's topped the position in average depth of target each of the past two years. Olsen enters his age-32 season as a near lock to find pay dirt more often. He's a strong, reliable TE1."
Allen Robinson,"Robinson was undoubtedly one of the biggest disappointments in fantasy last season. In 2015, Robinson's 1,400 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns powered him to the sixth-most fantasy points at the position. His playing time and targets actually increased in 2016 and yet he plummeted to 883 yards, six scores and a 25th-place finish. The difference? The long ball. In 2015, Robinson caught 15 of 43 targets 20-plus yards down field for 591 yards and two touchdowns. In 2016, he caught one of 24 for 24 yards and no scores. It's fair to expect some regression to the mean here, but Blake Bortles' shortcomings will continue to handcuff Robinson."
Jamison Crowder,"Despite absolutely disappearing during the fantasy playoffs last season, Crowder enjoyed a breakout second NFL season and was one of fantasy's most consistent wide receivers. He posted a top-30 fantasy week during 56 percent of his outings (12th best) but was limited to a pair of top-10 weeks. Crowder's touchdown total (seven) is likely unsustainable considering his size (5-foot-8, 185 pounds) and short-area/slot role that resulted in a 7.8 average depth of target (11th lowest) and six end zone targets (49th most). Of course, Crowder's role figures to increase in his third year, and with DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon gone. The Duke product is a sleeper for 90-plus catches and is a solid WR3 target."
Joe Mixon,"If not for his character concerns, Mixon would have been a near lock to come off the board in the first round of April's draft. Instead, he fell to Cincinnati at 48th overall. Mixon is an explosive runner and an elite pass-catching prospect. He has a big frame (6-foot-1, 225 pounds) and is only 20 years old. Mixon struggled with negative runs (21 percent) at Oklahoma last year but made up for it with dominant post-contact production (2.6 YAC). Also a terrific returner, Mixon can contribute in all areas out of the gate.  Mixon's combination of size, speed, athleticism and versatility supplies him with elite upside. He's the favorite for lead-back duties, but will need to fend off Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard for snaps."
Tyreek Hill,"The Chiefs selected Hill in the fifth round of last year's draft amid significant character concerns. Despite the late flier, Hill made an immediate impact, scoring 12 all-purpose touchdowns en route to finishing top-10 among wideouts in fantasy points during 19 percent of his games (18th best). He was the 19th-highest-scoring receiver overall (11th in non-PPR), and fourth from Week 8 on. Hill's role is expected to increase in his second year, but considering his obligations on special teams and 185-pound frame, he's an extremely poor bet to come close to his rookie-season-touchdown total (see Cordarrelle Patterson ad Tavon Austin). Hill is best viewed as flex who will provide boom/bust production."
Kelvin Benjamin,"Benjamin missed all of 2015 with a torn ACL, but he has managed top-20 non-PPR fantasy campaigns during his two full seasons. Although an impressive feat, it can't be ignored that Benjamin's usage and production was down significantly from 2014 to 2016. Additionally, he was fantasy's top-scoring wideout through two games last season but was 42nd from that point on. Benjamin's efficiency is far from ideal (career 53 percent catch rate, 7.6 yards per target), but his 6-foot-5, 245-pound frame generates him a ton of goal-line work. Benjamin paced the NFL with 24 end zone targets as a rookie and ranked 11th with 13 last year. The big man is best viewed as WR3 and should be upgraded in non-PPR."
Drew Brees,"As consistently dominant as they come, Brees has finished as a top-three fantasy quarterback during seven of the past 11 seasons, and no worse than sixth during that span. He's ranked top-two in the NFL in attempts, completions, yardage and completion percentage during six of the past seven seasons. Incredible. Brees was off target on an NFL-best 9.7 percent of his throws last season and has led the NFL in the category during four of the past six years. The loss of Brandin Cooks is far from ideal, but Brees' success has been built on spreading the ball around anyway. Expect Brees, 38, to provide nothing less than another top-five fantasy campaign."
Sammy Watkins,"Injuries have limited Watkins to 21 games over the past two seasons, leaving the super-talented wideout as one of the most intriguing post-hype targets in fantasy this season. During his career, the 2014 first-round pick is averaging 7.8 targets per game (27 percent share) in the 32 games he's played at least 70 percent of the pass play snaps. Watkins was fantasy's No. 6 wide receiver during the 11 weeks that fit that bill in 2015. He was limited to 28 receptions for 430 yards and two touchdowns over eight games last season. Watkins turns 24 this summer and is in line for a massive workload again this season. He's a fine WR2 target, but will hope for a big step forward from Jared Goff."
Mark Ingram,"Ingram brushed aside durability concerns by appearing in 16 games for only the second time in his career last season. The 27-year-old has now finished as a top-15 fantasy back in three consecutive seasons, registering at least 4.6 YPC and 46 receptions during each of the past two years. In fact, Ingram's 5.1 YPC was ninth best in the NFL last season. Ingram remains the lead back in New Orleans' high-scoring offense, but will share carries with Adrian Peterson and passing-down work with rookie Alvin Kamara. He's a back-end RB2."
Frank Gore,"Gore dodged Father Time yet again in 2016 and has finished as a top-21 fantasy back in 11 consecutive seasons. The 34-year-old hasn't missed a game since 2010. Gore was limited to four rushing scores on 263 carries (seventh) last season, but he made up for it with a career-high four touchdown catches. Gore finished 12th at the position in fantasy points, but he was limited to two top-10 fantasy weeks and averaged 1.49 yards after contact per attempt, his lowest mark since we began tracking in 2009. Gore has very little upside, but he's still positioned for a high-volume role in a productive Colts offense."
Pierre Garcon,"Garcon joins the 49ers this year after arguably the best season of his career. He caught a career-high 71 percent of his targets (16th best) and posted a 9.4 yards per target (11th) in Washington last year. Garcon's biggest statistical issue has been touchdowns. In nine years, he has yet to find the end zone more than six times in a season. Since 2009, he ranks eighth in the NFL in targets (902) but 20th in end zone targets (65). Garcon has finished a season better than 23rd among receivers in fantasy points only once (11th in 2013) and required an NFL-high 176 targets to get there. Garcon is now 30 years old but sports sure hands (three drops in three years) and won't be short on targets as the 49ers' top wideout. He's in the WR3 discussion, especially in PPR."
Stefon Diggs,"Minnesota found a gem in Diggs in the fifth round of the 2015 draft, but the 23-year-old's fantasy production has been capped by the team's conservative offense. Last season, Diggs caught 84 passes (14th most) in only 13 games thanks to a 76 percent catch rate (fifth best). Despite the heavy usage, Diggs accrued only 903 yards and three touchdowns. He finished 31st at the position in fantasy points and managed only five top-30 fantasy weeks. Diggs is a terrific player who might eventually break out in fantasy stardom, but in the meantime, he's essentially a poor man's Jarvis Landry in Minnesota's low-scoring offense."
Martavis Bryant,"Bryant has been on the field for at least 70 percent of the Steelers' pass plays during 12 of his 24 career games (11 of which came in 2015). During those 12 showings, he handled 9.5 targets per game (25 percent share). Bryant ranked 10th among wideouts in fantasy points during the weeks he was a full go in 2015, and he scored eight touchdowns and ranked 20th during the 10 weeks he was active as a rookie. Bryant was suspended all of last season, but has been reinstated and is all systems go for 2017. The 6-foot-4 deep threat has WR2 upside in Pittsburgh's high-scoring offense."
Brandon Marshall,"Marshall is now 33 years old and coming off of his worst statistical season since his 2006 rookie campaign. He joins the Giants, with whom he'll be positioned for a major role in an offense that had at least three wide receivers on the field for an NFL-high 97 percent of its pass plays last season. Marshall's target share might dip, but he figures to remain very busy near the goal line. He's ranked seventh or higher among wide receivers in end zone targets nine of the past 10 years, and he paces the entire NFL in the category over the past decade (180). Marshall's age is a concern, but he'll see enough work in this offense to allow fringe WR3 production."
Matt Ryan,"The Falcons' offense absolutely exploded during Kyle Shanahan's second season calling the plays and although Shanahan is off to San Francisco, we shouldn't expect anything more than some regression to the mean. Ryan enjoyed a career-best season in 2016, ranking second in passing yards, passing touchdowns and fantasy points. He averaged an absurd 9.26 yards per attempt, which is the best we've seen in the NFL since Kurt Warner hit 9.88 in 2000. Ryan benefited from the league's most help after the catch (6.2 RAC) and second-lowest drop rate (2.8 percent), but his superb accuracy (fourth or better in off-target percentage each of the past five years) and the presence of Julio Jones will allow him to post another strong fantasy season."
Mike Gillislee,"Gillislee didn't last long in Miami after they selected him with a fifth-round pick back in 2013, but he resurrected his career during his time in Buffalo. Gillislee made a good first impression by averaging 5.7 YPC on 47 carries in 2015 and was actually able to match that mark on 101 attempts last season. He also scored a whopping nine touchdowns on 110 touches. Although he's played well, Gillislee has benefited from exceptional blocking. He was allowed 4.8 yards before contact per attempt in 2015, and his 3.9 rate in 2016 was second highest in the NFL. Gillislee was snatched up by New England as a restricted free agent and is positioned as the team's early-down and goal line replacement for LeGarrette Blount. Gillislee won't match Blount's 18 touchdowns from last season, but he has double-digit touchdown upside and can do more as a receiver."
Theo Riddick,"The season-ending injury to Ameer Abdullah forced Riddick into a larger-than-anticipated role last season. Although Riddick was productive in fantasy, it was mostly due to his dominance as a receiver and in spite of his struggles as a rusher. Riddick has averaged 3.5 YPC on 164 career carries, including only 1.5 yards after contact. Of course, the return of Abdullah will allow Riddick to settle back into his happy place as one of the game's top receiving backs. Even after missing six games last year, he ranks second in targets (163), first in receptions (133), second in receiving yards (1,068) and tied for first in receiving touchdowns (8) among backs over the past two years. The 26-year-old is a fringe RB2 who should be downgraded in non-PPR."
Willie Snead,"Snead is yet another example of Drew Brees' raising a relative unknown to fantasy relevance. Snead went undrafted in 2014 and made his NFL debut in 2015. He's posted a pair of top-34 fantasy campaigns over the past two seasons despite scoring a grand total of seven touchdowns. Of Snead's 103 targets last season, an NFL-low 5.8 percent were charted as off target. Snead's scoring deficiencies and short-area role led to a 7.4 average depth of target (10th lowest) and allowed only three top-20 fantasy weeks. Of course, with Brandin Cooks gone, Snead is again assured a big role in 2017. He's a solid WR3 who should be downgraded in non-PPR."
Paul Perkins,"The Giants selected Perkins in the fifth round of the 2016 draft, and following the offseason release of Rashad Jennings, Perkins is positioned for a larger role in his second year. Perkins, of course, will need to earn the Giants' lead back role after a pedestrian rookie campaign. He averaged 4.1 YPC, 1.6 of which came after contact, and per Pro Football Focus, he forced only 10 missed tackles (0.09 rate, ranked 10th worst). Perkins faced a league-low average of 6.57 defenders in the box. Of course, there's still a lot to like about a player who is only 22 years old and was extremely elusive during his time at UCLA. He shouldn't have much trouble fending off Wayne Gallman, Shaun Draughn and Shane Vereen for carries."
Spencer Ware,"Ware has certainly come a long way since being drafted as a fullback in the sixth round of the 2013 draft before eventually being waived. Operating as Kansas City's lead back last year, Ware ranked 16th at the position in rushing yards and sixth in receiving yards. During the 12 games he played in full, Ware handled a hefty 16.2 carries and 3.1 targets per game. He ranked ninth at the position in fantasy points during those weeks. Ware is again positioned for a significant role in Andy Reid's running back-friendly offense, but he'll need to fend off intriguing rookie Kareem Hunt. The 25-year-old is a fringe RB2 with 10-touchdown upside."
Ameer Abdullah,"Detroit's 2015 second-round pick, Abdullah accrued 597 yards on 143 carries (4.2 YPC) as a rookie and was impressive over a small sample in 2016, with 18 carries for 101 yards (5.6 YPC, 3.2 YAC) before suffering a season-ending foot injury early in the season. Abdullah is a near-lock to share Detroit's backfield with passing-down specialist Theo Riddick and, to a lesser extent, short-yardage back Zach Zenner. It's realistic, though, that the shifty Abdullah will emerge into feature-back duties. He is only 23 years old and makes for a terrific post-hype target."
Adrian Peterson,"A torn meniscus limited Peterson to three games last season, which means he has now failed to eclipse 40 touches during two of the past three years. Of course, bookended by those two seasons was a 2015 campaign in which Peterson racked up 1,707 yards and 11 touchdowns on 357 touches. Peterson has scored double-digit touchdowns during all eight seasons other than the aforementioned 2014 and 2016 disasters. Of course, now 32 years old and sharing backfield duties with Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara in New Orleans, Peterson won't come close to the 325 touches he averaged during his 'full' seasons in Minnesota. He's a flex option who offers little as a receiver and should thus be upgraded slightly in non-PPR. "
C.J. Anderson,"Anderson's disappointing 2016 campaign ended prematurely after he tore his meniscus in Week 7. It was bad timing, as Anderson was coming off one of his best games of the year, which included a highlight-reel catch-and-run touchdown called back on an irrelevant penalty. Nonetheless, Anderson averaged a career-worst 4.0 YPC, including 1.5 after contact, which is an area he found had a ton of success in earlier in his career. Anderson will need to fend off both Devontae Booker, who struggled mightily in his place last season, and injury-plagued Jamaal Charles for snaps this season. The 26-year-old is a fine post-hype target, but may struggle to receive more than a dozen touches per game."
Delanie Walker,"Walker has flourished since joining the Titans. He's posted a top-11 fantasy season each of his four seasons with the team, including a top-five finish in each of the past two years. Walker's targets, receptions and yardage fell off significantly from 2015 to 2016, but he set career highs with eight end zone targets and seven touchdowns. Walker turns 33 this year and has missed exactly one game each of the past four seasons, but he's one of the league's best two-way tight ends and a big part of Tennessee's passing game. He's a high-floor TE1."
Russell Wilson,"Limited by injuries throughout 2016, Wilson failed to finish as a top-10 fantasy quarterback for the first time in his career. Wilson tossed 21 touchdowns (second lowest of his career) and rushed for a career-low 259 yards on 72 carries. On the plus side, Seattle leaned more on its passing game, which allowed Wilson a career-high 4,219 passing yards (10th in the NFL). He's finished no worse than 11th in yards per attempt and no lower than third in carries among quarterbacks during each of his five pro seasons. Wilson's low fantasy ceiling (just six top-10 weeks) and massive bust rate (seven weeks outside the top 20) are red flags, but Wilson will certainly be a rebound candidate at full health in 2017."
Robert Kelley,"Kelley went undrafted last year, but by midseason he had taken over as Washington's workhorse back. A 220-pound bruiser, Kelley played more than 13 percent of the team's snaps for the first time in Week 8. From that point on, he appeared in nine games, was on the field for 54 percent of the team's offensive snaps and handled 74 percent of the designed runs (16.8 per game) and 6 percent of the targets (1.9 per game). Only 14 running backs scored more fantasy points in that span. For the year, Kelley averaged 2.2 yards after contact (ninth best). Kelley will compete for early-down duties with rookie Samaje Perine and defer passing-down duties to Chris Thompson. He's barely in the RB2 discussion in non-PPR leagues."
Jimmy Graham,"Graham spent last offseason recovering from a torn patellar tendon, which raised questions as to whether or not he'd ever return to his All-Pro form. Graham, who turns 31 this year, put those concerns to rest by appearing in all 16 of Seattle's games and posting career highs in yards per target (9.8) and yards after catch (5.0). Graham was limited to six touchdowns, but paced the position with 13 end zone targets. Graham posted his fifth top-four fantasy season in six years and will be even healthier entering 2017. He's a strong TE1 option."
Kyle Rudolph,"It didn't take Rudolph long to become Sam Bradford's favorite target last season. The veteran tight end paced all tight ends with 128 targets and ranked top four in receptions, yards, touchdowns and end zone targets (11). Rudolph finished second at the position in fantasy points, his best ranking since he landed 11th in 2012. As for sustainability, consider that tight ends have accounted for a 24 percent target share during Vikings offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur's 122 games as a head coach or coordinator since 2009. Rudolph shouldn't have much trouble repeating his 22 percent target share, which will help him finish as a top-10 fantasy tight end."
DeSean Jackson,"The Buccaneers entered the offseason eyeing a speed complement to Mike Evans, and they certainly found one in Jackson. Last season in Washington, Jackson posted the fifth 1,000-yard campaign of his career. He averaged 17.9 yards per catch, and he has finished top-10 in that category in six of his eight seasons. Of course, there are two concerns here: touchdowns and durability. Jackson has eclipsed six touchdowns in a season twice in his career and has scored exactly four touchdowns during his past two campaigns. He's also missed at least one game during seven of his nine NFL seasons, including eight during the past two years. Nonetheless, Jackson is explosive enough to warrant WR3 consideration."
Eric Decker,"During his three seasons with the Jets, there were 31 games in which Decker was on the field for at least two-thirds of the team's pass plays. He averaged 8.3 targets per game (26 percent share) during that span. Decker posted a trio of top-15 fantasy campaigns during the four seasons leading up to a 2016 that was derailed by shoulder and hip injuries. Decker's consistency in 2015 was nothing short of incredible: He finished all 15 of his starts as a top-35 fantasy receiver. Now with the emerging Titans, the perpetually underrated Decker will compete for targets with Corey Davis, Rishard Matthews and Delanie Walker. The 30-year-old is best viewed as a flex option."
Jeremy Maclin,"Maclin handled 8.4 targets per game (31 percent share) during the 14 games he was on the field for at least two-thirds of the team's pass plays during his first season (2015) with the Chiefs. He played 12 such games last season, but his targets fell to 6.5 per game (20 percent share). The emergence of Tyreek Hill was obviously a factor, but Maclin's play also fell off a bit. He posted career-low marks in targets, receptions, yards, touchdowns, yards per reception, yards per target and yards after catch. Maclin turned 29 this year, so age isn't a factor yet, and he's a decent bet to lead the Ravens in targets."
Cameron Meredith,"Meredith went undrafted in 2015, but joined Chicago as an intriguing 6-foot-3, 215-pound converted quarterback. He played sparingly as a rookie and was a nonfactor during the first four weeks of 2016. Promoted into an every-down role in Week 5, he was targeted 12 times and led the NFL with 27 targets during Weeks 5-6. Meredith averaged a healthy 7.3 targets per game (21 percent share) during the 12 games in which he played at least 40 percent of the pass play snaps; only 17 receivers scored more fantasy points after Week 4. Alshon Jeffery is gone, leaving Kevin White, Kendall Wright and Markus Wheaton as Meredith's competition for snaps. He's positioned well for flex production."
LeGarrette Blount,"Blount had some highlight moments during his time with New England, but it all came together for a career year in 2016. The perpetually underrated big man ran for a league-high 18 touchdowns during 16 regular-season games. Of his 299 carries, an NFL-high 24 came inside the opponent's 5-yard line. Blount averaged 3.9 YPC but faced a league-high average of 8.3 in-box defenders. Blount is now 30 years old and has never eclipsed 15 receptions in a season. Now in Philadelphia, Blount will slide in as the team's primary early down and short-yardage back, but won't see many targets. He's best-viewed as a flex and should be upgraded in non-PPR."
Duke Johnson Jr.,"Johnson has spent most of the first two seasons of his career dominating as a pass-catcher, but he quietly took a sizable step forward as a rusher last season. The Miami product improved his 3.6 rookie-season YPC to 4.9, which was 12th best in the league. Since entering the league via the third round of the 2015 draft, Johnson ranks fourth among backs in receptions (114) and third in receiving yards (1,048) but has caught only two touchdowns. Johnson's lack of scoring (three in two years) has limited him to a grand total of one top-10 fantasy week. Johnson enters 2016 as the passing-down complement to Isaiah Crowell, but it's still possible the 23-year-old eventually jumps Crowell on the depth chart."
DeVante Parker,"Parker took a step forward during his second NFL season, but the 2015 first-round pick has yet to emerge into a reliable go-to receiver and drew criticism from head coach Adam Gase during the offseason. Parker (6-foot-3) was limited to four touchdowns and seven end zone targets last year. He managed one top-10 fantasy week and two additional top-20 outings. Parker is only 24 years old and has shown flashes, but he remains a speculative midround fantasy pick. His upside makes him well worth your attention on draft day."
Donte Moncrief,"Moncrief has finished his three NFL seasons ranked 79th, 36th and, most recently, 75th at the position in fantasy points. The former third-round pick failed to post a single weekly fantasy finish better than 14th (his only top 20), and he was extremely touchdown dependent last year. Moncrief scored exactly one touchdown in seven of his nine games and finished the other two weeks 110th among fantasy receivers. He averaged an underwhelming 6.1 targets per game, and he's ranked in the bottom 15 percent at the position in yards per target each of the past two years. Of course, Moncrief is still only 23 years old and has a ton of fantasy upside as Andrew Luck's No. 2 target. His underwhelming usage and effectiveness are red flags, but he's worth post-hype flex consideration."
Andrew Luck,"Luck, 27, has struggled with injuries (10 missed games during the past two seasons) and a poor supporting cast, but he has still managed plenty of fantasy production when active. He has finished as a top-four fantasy quarterback during three of the past four seasons. Last season, he ranked eighth in passing yards, fifth in passing touchdowns and seventh in rushing yards among quarterbacks. He averaged 7.8 yards per attempt, which was fifth best in the league. AFC South defenses are improving, but Luck is one of the league's most talented and highly efficient passers and works in a pass-first offense. He's a top-end QB1 option."
Kenny Britt,"Britt joins the Browns after what was, by far, the best season of his career. With the Rams last year, Britt set career highs in targets and receptions and reached 1,000 yards for the first time in eight seasons. Los Angeles' horrible passing game limited him to five touchdowns, but Britt still finished 29th at the position in PPR fantasy points in 15 games of work. He averaged a healthy 9.1 yards per target and is the only player in the NFL to rank top-18 in the category each of the past three years. Cleveland's offensive woes will limit Britt's fantasy upside, but he's a good player and will see enough work to allow flex production."
Eddie Lacy,"The combination of Lacy's weight struggles and high-end effectiveness have suddenly turned him into one of the league's most-polarizing players. Before going down with an ankle injury last season, Lacy averaged 5.1 YPC (10th), including 2.8 after contact (second), and he forced one missed tackle for every 0.27 carries (second), according to Pro Football Focus. Lacy has averaged at least 4.1 YPC during each of his four NFL campaigns, including at least 4.6 YPC during two of those seasons. He forced missed tackles at a high rate, was terrific after contact during his four years in Green Bay and now heads to Seattle, where he'll settle in as the early-down complement to C.J. Prosise. Lacy adds very little as a receiver but has double-digit touchdown upside in a quality Seattle offense."
Tevin Coleman,"Coleman was Atlanta's third-round pick in 2015, but Devonta Freeman's dominant play has kept him from fully emerging. Coleman has been terrific in his own right, especially as a pass-catcher. He totaled 11 touchdowns on only 149 touches last season, and though that is far from sustainable, he averaged 4.4 YPC and 13.6 YPR. Coleman's upside will be limited as long as Freeman is on the field, but he has some stand-alone flex appeal and is one of the most valuable handcuffs in fantasy."
Mike Wallace,"Following a rough 2015 in Minnesota, Wallace enjoyed a bit of a bounce back in Baltimore's pass-heavy offense last season. Wallace reached 1,000 receiving yards for the first time since 2011, and ended up with his sixth top-25 fantasy season over the past seven years. Despite his success and the retirement of Steve Smith, it's fair to expect Wallace's efficiency to take a step back in 2017. His catch rate (64 percent), yards per target (9.0) and yards-after-catch average (5.8) were all well above his norms over the past half-decade. His targets also took a dive from 8.0 per game in the first half of last season to 6.1 in the second half. The 31-year-old is best viewed as a flex option."
Terrance West,"West joined Baltimore late during the 2015 season after failing to emerge during stints with Cleveland, which drafted him in the third round of the 2014 draft, and Tennessee. West racked up 1,010 yards and six scores in 227 touches in 2016 but progressively ceded snaps to Kenneth Dixon and Kyle Juszczyk as the season went on. West has proved to be a replacement-level back, but the 26-year-old will play an expanded role this season with Kenneth Dixon on IR."
Adam Thielen,"Thielen went undrafted in 2014 and totaled 20 receptions during his first two NFL seasons, so his breakout 2016 season was certainly a surprise. Thielen (6-foot-2, 200 pounds) turns 27 this year and is coming off a campaign in which he caught 74 percent of his targets (ranking seventh), averaged 10.4 yards per target (fifth) and dropped only one of 93 targets. Thielen's 2016 production was extremely boom/bust -- two top-seven fantasy weeks and three additional top-30 outings -- but he has clearly emerged as Minnesota's top perimeter receiver. He's a quality flex target."
James White,"White has quickly emerged as one of the game's premier pass-catching backs. Prior to racking up 139 yards and three touchdowns against Atlanta in the Super Bowl, White finished third among backs in targets, receptions and receiving yards during the regular season. He paces all backs with nine receiving touchdowns over the past two seasons. White's fantasy upside is capped by a near-nonexistent role as a rusher (career-high 39 carries last season) and he'll face competition for snaps from Dion Lewis and newcomers Mike Gillislee and Rex Burkhead. White is only a flex option in PPR formats."
Cam Newton,"Needless to say, 2016 was a disappointing season for Newton. One year after posting 45 more fantasy points than any other player, Newton fell to 17th at the position. He posted just five top-10 fantasy weeks, and only three after Week 2. Newton's completion percentage dipped to a league-worst 53 percent and he was off target on 21.8 percent of his throws (second worst), although in fairness his 10.6 average depth of throw was tops in the NFL. Newton posted career lows in carries (90) and rushing yards (359), and his five rushing scores were half his 2015 total. Newton is still only 27 and thus is a rebound candidate in an offense that quietly led on 45 percent of its plays last season (fifth highest). The additions of Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel figure to add to the offense's efficiency."
Tyrell Williams,"Season-ending injuries to both Keenan Allen and Stevie Johnson forced Williams into a significant offensive role last season. The 2015 undrafted free-agent signing took the promotion in stride, ranking 15th at the position in receiving yards and 14th in touchdowns. Williams dropped six balls but was otherwise very efficient. He averaged 9.2 yards per target (15th) and 6.6 yards after the catch (fifth). Williams finished half of his outings as a top-20 non-PPR fantasy receiver, which was the fifth-best rate at the position. Williams' usage is sure to take a big hit this season with Allen back and No. 7 overall pick Mike Williams now in the mix. Tyrell is a fast 6-foot-4 receiver who is still on the rise at the age of 25, but he's unlikely to see enough targets to warrant flex consideration."
Matt Forte,"Forte spent most of his first season in New York as the Jets' lead back, but he went down with a knee injury in Week 14 and Bilal Powell quickly proved to be a more effective back. Forte averaged 3.7 YPC, including 1.5 after contact, both of which were his worst marks since 2009. He finished a career-worst 21st at the position in fantasy points and has now missed five games because of injury over the past two seasons. Forte is now 31 years old and on the short end of a committee in what is likely to be one of the league's lowest-scoring offenses."
Kareem Hunt,"Hunt isn't the most explosive back, but his tape shows a versatile player who is extremely hard to bring down. Per Pro Football Focus, the 5-foot-10, 216-pound back forced an FBS-best 100 missed tackles on 303 touches during the 2016 season. In turn, he ended up as the site's highest-graded FBS running back. Despite a high 4.6 average depth of target, he caught 93 percent of his targets. Hunt is a potential three-down back at the NFL level and landed in a terrific situation in Andy Reid's running back-friendly offense. Hunt will start out behind Spencer Ware, but he's one injury away from flirting with RB1 numbers."
Zach Ertz,"Ertz has finished fifth in targets and top nine in fantasy points at the tight end position each of the past two seasons. He's shown terrific hands (10 drops) in his career, but has really struggled to find the end zone. Since entering the league in 2013, Ertz ranks seventh in targets (362) and 17th in touchdowns (13) at the position. On the plus side, he set a career-high with nine end-zone targets (fifth-most in the NFL among TEs) last year. The tight end position has been extremely busy (minimum 27 percent target share) during head coach Doug Pederson's seasons as a coach and coordinator, but Ertz's role figures to be reduced after the team's signings of Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith. Ertz is a back-end TE1."
Darren McFadden,"An arm injury limited McFadden to three games last season, but Dallas brought the 29-year-old back as Ezekiel Elliott's direct backup. Working behind Dallas' offensive line in 2015, McFadden accrued 1,417 yards on 279 touches. Working as the lead back from Weeks 7-17 that year, he averaged the same carry share and a slightly larger target share than Elliott did in 2016. This is important considering Elliott's six-game suspension to begin 2017. McFadden is the heavy favorite for lead back duties and on the RB1 radar. He'll revert to a high ceiling handcuff upon Elliott's return in Week 8."
Kirk Cousins,"Cousins' breakout 2015 campaign saw him finish 10th in the league in passing yards (4,166), eighth in yards per attempt (7.7) and eighth in fantasy points. He was even better last season, ranking third in yards (4,915), third in YPA (8.1) and fifth in fantasy points. Cousins has a reputation for being too conservative, but his 8.9 average depth of throw was ninth highest in the league in 2016. He's shown good accuracy and quietly ranks third at the position with nine rushing scores over the past two years. Cousins will be without Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson this season, but he's still sitting pretty with Jordan Reed, Terrelle Pryor Sr., Jamison Crowder and Josh Doctson."
Doug Martin,"Martin's 2016 season was a disaster from all angles. He entered the year off a 1,673-yard bounce-back campaign that landed him a five-year, $35.75 million extension. He went on to appear in only eight games due to injury and suspension and posted a 2.9 YPC (fourth worst). Of course, in his defense, Martin was afforded 1.1 yards before contact per attempt, which was second lowest in the NFL and down from 2.8 in 2015. Martin has now missed at least five games during three of the past four years and averaged 3.7 YPC or worse during those three seasons. He's also suspended three games to start 2017 and is thus worth no more than a mid-round pick."
Rishard Matthews,"Matthews was fantasy's No. 22 scoring wide receiver last year (No. 15 in non-PPR), but he was actually a part-time player until midseason. Matthews was on the field for 62 percent of Tennessee's pass plays during his first seven games, but 95 percent from that point on. Matthews handled 4.9 targets per game (16 percent share) during the first stretch and 8.0 (28 percent) during the remainder of the season. Matthews is a poor bet to repeat his touchdown total of nine, especially with Corey Davis and Eric Decker in the mix, but he's an underrated and reliable target who can work on all areas of the field. He's a solid late-round target."
Darren Sproles,"The ageless Sproles announced last year that 2017 would be his last in the NFL. He's coming off yet another strong campaign in which he caught at least 40 passes for the eighth consecutive season. That includes at least 52 receptions during each of the past two years and six of the past seven seasons. After posting a 3.8 YPC in 2015, Sproles bounced back to 4.7 (17th) last year. Sproles will spend his final season handling 10 or so touches per game as a complement to Wendell Smallwood and rookie Donnel Pumphrey."
C.J. Prosise,"Seattle selected Prosise in the third round of last year's draft with the expectation that he'd handle change-of-pace and passing-down duties. A converted wide receiver, he was limited to 47 touches as a rookie because of injuries but was impressive when called upon. Prosise averaged 5.7 YPC on 30 carries and hauled in all but one of his 18 targets for 208 yards. The 23-year-old clocked a 4.48 40-yard dash at 6-feet, 220 pounds last year and has tremendous playmaking and receiving ability. He figures to push for 8-10 touches as a complement to Eddie Lacy and/or Thomas Rawls, but there's upside here."
Giovani Bernard,"Bernard had racked up 673 yards and three touchdowns on 130 touches before suffering a season-ending torn ACL in Week 11 last season. He was averaging a career-worst 3.7 YPC, but he was well on his way to another strong PPR campaign. He finished 20th at the position in receptions in 10 games after finishing top 12 each of the previous three seasons. Bernard doesn't score many touchdowns and lacks upside as a result of his role, but he certainly does enough to warrant flex consideration. The ACL recovery and the progress of rookie Joe Mixon will determine how much we can expect from Bernard in 2017. "
Jonathan Stewart,"Stewart had a quality 2016 campaign for Carolina, although a lot of his fantasy success was tied to touchdowns. He ranked fifth among backs in carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (16) and was eighth in rushing touchdowns (9). He was limited to 3.8 YPC, but only 1.9 of that came before initial contact (15th lowest). Stewart offers close to nothing as a pass-catcher, recording just eight receptions for 60 yards last season. That's a major detriment to his fantasy production. His offseason contract extension suggests he'll maintain a role in 2017, but Christian McCaffrey is now the fantasy back to own in Carolina. At best, Stewart is a touchdown-dependent flex in non-PPR leagues."
Thomas Rawls,"Rawls' career has been quite the roller coaster thus far. He went undrafted out of Central Michigan in 2015, but Seattle scooped him up and watched him produce 830 yards and four touchdowns on 147 rookie-season carries. That 5.6 YPC was tops in the NFL, and his 2.7 post-contact average ranked third. A laundry list of injuries limited Rawls to nine games last season and, although his 3.2 YPC during the regular season was ugly, he did explode for 195 yards on 38 postseason attempts. Rawls is only 23 years old but figures to open 2017 behind Eddie Lacy and passing-down specialist C.J. Prosise. Rawls' flashes of upside make him worth a late-round flier."
Tyler Eifert,"Eifert has been a disappointment since being selected in the first round of the 2013 draft, but his issues have been with durability, not on-field play. Eifert has yet to play a full 16-game season and has missed 26 games (41 percent) of the Bengals' 64 regular season games since 2013. Despite missing 11 games in the past two years, Eifert has racked up 18 touchdowns (most at the position) and 19 end zone targets (third most) during the span. He posted a top-10 fantasy week during 54 percent of his appearances in 2015 (seventh highest) and 63 percent last season (second highest). Eifert's touchdown production is hard to count on long term, and his durability is a major concern, but he's a big part of a Bengals offense likely to rebound this season. He's a quality TE1 and will be available at a discount on draft day."
Jordan Matthews,"Matthews scored eight touchdowns and ranked as a top-25 fantasy wide receiver during each of his first two seasons in the NFL. The wheels fell off last year, though, as he missed a pair of games due to injury and scored only three times despite a career-high 11 end zone targets. He posted only four top-30 fantasy weeks en route to finishing 44th at the position in points. Traded to Buffalo, Matthews is the best bet to lead the team in targets. He's still a flex option, but he has a limited upside as a short-area, slot target who has struggled on the perimeter. "
Corey Coleman,"Coleman was the first wide receiver selected in the 2016 draft, but a broken hand limited him to 10 games. The Baylor product averaged 6.9 targets per game (22 percent share) and was on the field for 92 percent of Cleveland's pass plays when active. Coleman was used often as a deep threat; his 13.6 average depth target ranked 13th among receivers. He caught 48 percent of balls thrown his way (sixth worst) and averaged 6.0 yards per target (10th worst). Coleman's rookie campaign was obviously a disappointment, but he's only 23 years old and locked into an every-down role opposite Kenny Britt. He'll need to be on your radar in the middle rounds."
Corey Davis,"The wide receiver-needy Titans selected Davis with the fifth-overall pick in April's draft. Davis found the end zone 19 times, averaged 10.9 yards per target and caught 71 percent of his targets during a dominant final campaign at Western Michigan. The 22-year-old combines great size (6-foot-3, 209 pounds) with terrific route running. He obviously had plenty of success near the goal line, and his big frame will lead to a significant amount of work in that area at the NFL level. Davis has little blocking experience, but he can line up in all of the formations and make plays downfield. Tennessee's run-first offense hurts his upside, but Davis is good enough and will play enough to push for WR3 numbers as a rookie. "
Randall Cobb,"Cobb is only 26 years old and a top-three target in Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers-led offense, but he simply can't be trusted as any more than a flex after two consecutive disappointing seasons. Cobb finished eighth among wide receivers in fantasy points in 2014, but fell to 26th in 2015 and 52nd (in 13 games) last season. Cobb has posted two top-10 fantasy weeks over the past two seasons. Cobb's efficiency has been fine -- he caught 74 percent of his targets (ranking eighth) and averaged 6.0 yards after the catch (ninth) last year -- but his role (6.5-yard average depth of target) limited him to a career-low 10.2 yards per catch (10th lowest). Downgrade Green Bay's slot receiver slightly in non-PPR."
Jacquizz Rodgers,"A longtime complementary back, Rodgers flourished as a lead back in place of Doug Martin down the stretch last season. Rodgers set career highs in carries (129), rushing yards (560), yards per carry (4.3) and yards after contact per attempt (2.0), the latter of which ranked 14th in the league. He ranked eighth at the position in fantasy points during the five weeks in which he played at least 60 percent of the Bucs' snaps. Rodgers will open 2017 in a good spot as the early-down complement to Charles Sims and will later need to fend off Doug Martin once Martin returns from a three-game suspension."
Jameis Winston,"Now two seasons into his career, Winston has essentially been a poor man's Cam Newton. He's struggled badly with accuracy (third-worst off-target rate in both 2015 and 2016), but makes up for it by slinging the ball down field (10.3 average depth of throw ranked second in 2016) and with his legs (top-10 in carries at the position each of his first two seasons). Winston needs to tone down the turnovers (33 interceptions in two seasons), but the additions of DeSean Jackson and O.J. Howard will help, especially after his receivers averaged 4.0 yards after the catch last season (second lowest). Winston's lack of fantasy upside (seven career top-10 weeks) is a red flag, but the former No. 1 overall pick is a candidate for a leap forward with a better supporting cast in his third year."
Derek Carr,"Following an underwhelming rookie season and a solid sophomore campaign, Carr took another step forward in 2016. The former second-round pick tossed 28 touchdowns and only six interceptions. His completion rate improved to 64 percent despite 31 dropped passes; Carr has now ranked top-four in drops each of his three seasons. Granted, Carr's efficiency has been fairly average, but Oakland's terrific offensive line and the combination of Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree have helped him to a top-10 fantasy week during a healthy 45 percent of his past 31 starts. Carr is only 26, so it's possible we haven't yet seen his best work."
Zay Jones,"Jones was selected by the Bills in the second round of this year's draft. The East Carolina product was targeted a whopping 220 times last year and caught an NCAA record 158 passes for 1,746 yards and 8 touchdowns. He dropped only four passes, but his average depth of target (8.3) was very low. Jones also killed it at the combine, posting at least an above-average mark in every drill. Jones is 6-foot-2, 201 pounds and figures to immediately step in as Buffalo's No. 2 or 3 wideout alongside Jordan Matthews and Anquan Boldin. He's an intriguing PPR sleeper. "
Dak Prescott,"Say what you want about the Cowboys' offensive line, the quarterback still has to make throws. And Prescott did that at the highest level imaginable for a rookie last season. The fourth-round gem ranked 23rd in pass attempts, but posted a 23-to-4 TD/INT mark and ran for 282 yards and a position-high six touchdowns. Prescott ranked fourth in the league in completion percentage (68 percent) and yards per attempt (8.0). The rookie was fantasy's sixth-highest-scoring quarterback, but that's likely his ceiling unless 2016's run-heaviest offense is forced to throw the ball more often. Regardless, Prescott's efficiency and rushing ability keeps him in the top 10 at the position."
Sterling Shepard,"Shepard lacked a high ceiling and was a bit touchdown dependent, but he managed to post a 36th-place fantasy campaign as a rookie despite the Giants finishing 22nd in the league in offensive touchdowns. The second-round pick finished 44 percent of his appearances as a top-30 fantasy receiver (ranking 29th) and failed to post a single top-10 week. Shepard was on the field for an enormous 97.7 percent of the pass plays in a New York offense that almost always has three receivers on the field. That being the case, Brandon Marshall's presence won't cost Shepard many snaps, but is a near-lock to cost him in the touchdown department. Upgrade him slightly in PPR."
Josh Doctson,"Josh Doctson was the 22nd overall pick in the 2016 draft, but he missed nearly his entire rookie campaign with an Achilles injury. Both DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon are gone, which opens the door for Doctson to see the field often in his second season. The TCU product is already 24 years old but is 6-foot-2, 202 pounds and has big-time upside as a downfield playmaker. Doctson enjoyed a terrific final collegiate season before dominating nearly every aspect of the 2016 combine. Following what was essentially a redshirt rookie campaign, expect Doctson to play a significant offensive role in one of the league's better scoring offenses in 2017."
Martellus Bennett,"Bennett is now 30 years old and coming off a season in which he paced all tight ends by averaging 9.9 yards per target. He finished as a top-10 fantasy tight end for the third time in four years. Bennett was limited to 78 percent of the Patriots' offensive snaps last season, but, as one of the game's better two-way tight ends, he had been on the field for at least 90 percent of his team's snaps, when active, during each of the previous four seasons. Bennett will be no higher than third in the target pecking order in Green Bay, but that's not a bad place to be in an offense that was the pass-heaviest in the league and ranked third in touchdowns last season. Bennett is a fringe TE1."
Hunter Henry,"It's rare for a rookie tight end to make a splash in fantasy, but Henry did exactly that in 2016. The second-round pick was only on the field for 54 percent of San Diego's offensive snaps but scored a position-high eight touchdowns on 53 targets. He finished sixth in yards per target (9.0), fourth in post-catch yardage (5.5), second in end zone targets (12) and 19th in fantasy points (11th in non-PPR). Henry enters 2017 as a lock for an expanded role at the expense of 36-year-old Antonio Gates. With Philip Rivers under center, Henry is a candidate for his first top-12 fantasy season, but keep in mind that there are a lot of mouths to feed in this offense."
Jack Doyle,"Doyle was one of the top breakout players in fantasy last season. The 2013 undrafted free agent took advantage of Coby Fleener's departure and Dwayne Allen's struggles by catching 59 passes (11th-most at the position) and scoring five touchdowns. He finished 13th in fantasy points at the position and paced tight ends with a 79 percent catch rate. Doyle signed a three-year extension and Allen was traded to New England during the offseason. In the past 10 years, head coach Chuck Pagano (23 percent) and offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski's (26 percent) offenses have directed a minimum of 20 percent of the targets to the tight end position. Doyle is atop the depth chart and positioned to play a major role in an offense led by Andrew Luck. He's a TE2 with upside."
Marcus Mariota,"Mariota seemingly took a step forward in his second NFL season, but his statistical improvement was more related to volume than it was efficiency. In fact, his first- and second-season completion percentage, off-target rate and yards-per-attempt marks are almost exactly identical. Mariota ran for 349 yards and two touchdowns, which helped out his fantasy production, but he still fell short of finishing as a top-12 fantasy quarterback. Mariota's durability is also a slight red flag after he's missed five games in two seasons. The Oregon product's fantasy upside will also be limited by a Tennessee offense that called pass 55 percent of the time last season (second lowest). Especially with fifth overall pick Corey Davis now in the mix, Mariota is a strong QB2 option."
Derrick Henry,"Henry played second fiddle to DeMarco Murray as a rookie, but the 6-foot-3, 247-pound bruiser still managed 110 carries for 490 yards and 5 touchdowns. That's a healthy 4.5 YPC, 1.8 of which came after contact. Henry faced an average of 8.2 in-box defenders, which was third highest in the NFL. He also showed off some receiving chops by catching all but one of his 14 targets for 137 yards. As one of the most intriguing running back handcuffs, the 22-year-old Henry will probably be drafted too early in most leagues, but he'd certainly be in the RB1 mix if Murray were to miss time. "
Ted Ginn Jr.,"The ninth overall pick back in 2007, Ginn was a relative disappointment during the early portion of his career -- but he enjoyed a ton of success during his time in Carolina. He posted a career-best 44-739-10 line in 2015 and followed it up with a 54-752-4 last season. Ginn has struggled with drops (13 over the past two years), but offset it with his big-play ability. With Brandin Cooks gone to New England, Ginn will work as the Saints' second perimeter receiver opposite Michael Thomas, with Willie Snead in the slot. In that role, and with Drew Brees under center, the 32-year-old makes for a sneaky late-round target and flex option."
John Brown,"Brown is averaging 6.9 targets during 35 career games in which he's played at least 70 percent of Arizona's pass play snaps. The 2014 third-round pick was limited to 39 receptions by a sickle-cell issue last season, but the team has said it is now under control. Brown averaged 9.8 yards per target (10th best) and was fantasy's No. 25-scoring wide receiver in 2015. He ranked top-10 in average depth of target each of his first two years in the NFL and was 16th last year (13.5). Brown is a prime bounce-back candidate as an underrated Arizona offense's No. 2 wideout behind 33-year-old Larry Fitzgerald."
Matthew Stafford,"Stafford has suddenly become one of the most reliable quarterbacks in fantasy. He hasn't missed a game or finished lower than ninth in passing touchdowns in six seasons and has finished among the top-11 quarterbacks in fantasy points during five of those years. Last season, Stafford dealt with an NFL-high 32 drops, but he still completed 65 percent of his passes (12th best) and averaged 7.3 yards per attempt (14th). Stafford has converted into one of the game's most conservative passers (7.1 average depth of throw is third lowest in the NFL over the past three years), but it hasn't slowed his fantasy production. Offensive line improvements aside, Stafford's supporting cast won't be much better this season, but he remains a relatively safe back-end QB1."
Broncos D/ST,"The Broncos have ranked top-two in D/ST scoring each of the past two seasons, and their nine top-10 fantasy weeks tied Seattle for the most in 2016. The Broncos ranked fourth or better in fumble recoveries (13), sacks (42), yards allowed (5,057) and points allowed (297) last season. Unlike last offseason, Denver's defense saw very little turnover this year, which positions the likes of Von Miller, Brandon Marshall, Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. to lead this unit to another strong fantasy campaign."
Chris Thompson,"Thompson appeared in all 16 games as Washington's passing-down specialist behind Matt Jones and Rob Kelley last season. The 5-foot-8, 193-pound scat back finished top 15 at the position in targets, receptions and receiving scores. He also averaged 5.2 YPC (seventh) and scored a total of five touchdowns. Thompson's frame will always limit him to situational duties, but he's one of the best at what he does and is in an offense that has had a lot of success throwing the ball. He'll flirt with flex numbers, but should be downgraded in non-PPR."
Seahawks D/ST,"The Seahawks were the ninth-ranked D/ST last season, their worst finish since 2010. Seattle did, however, post nine top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied Denver for the most. The Seahawks were limited to 11 interceptions last season (21st in the NFL), but finished third in sacks (42) and third best in points allowed (292) after topping the league each of the previous four seasons. This defense saw very little turnover during the offseason, so we can expect another strong campaign from a unit stacked with Richard Sherman, Michael Bennett, Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright, Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas. Just plan on going a different direction come Week 1, with Seattle set to play in Green Bay."
Marvin Jones,"Jones was one of the top free-agent signings at wide receiver last offseason, latching on with Detroit following Calvin Johnson's retirement. Jones' Detroit career got off to a great start -- he paced all wideouts in fantasy points after a 205-yard Week 3 outing -- but things went south from there. Jones posted a 37-522-2 line from Week 4 on, which worked out to rank 64th in fantasy points at the position. Jones' 13.6-yard average depth of target (14th) allowed him a 16.9 YPR (fifth), but he managed to haul in only 53 percent of his targets and had seven drops (fourth most). Jones has fallen behind Golden Tate on the depth chart, and he's no more than a flex option in Detroit's conservative passing game."
Ben Roethlisberger,"Roethlisberger's shaky durability isn't new (at least one missed game during seven of the past 10 years), but he's recently turned into a must-start fantasy quarterback at home and a must-bench on the road. Over the past three years, Roethlisberger has a 59-to-16 TD/INT mark and sits third in fantasy points at Heinz Field. He sits at 23 TDs, 22 INTs and 18th in fantasy points during 22 road games in that span. Roethlisberger's efficiency took a hit across the board last season and, this may be hard to believe, but he's posted one top-10 fantasy campaign during the past seven years. It's possible the returns of Ladarius Green (health) and Martavis Bryant (suspension) will launch Roethlisberger back to fantasy stardom, but in the meantime, he's a borderline weekly starter."
Philip Rivers,"Quite incredibly, Rivers has started every single one of the Chargers' games over the past 11 years. He's thrown for at least 4,200 yards during seven of the past eight seasons and is averaging 30.0 passing touchdowns per season since 2008. Despite the volume, Rivers hasn't managed a top-10 fantasy campaign since 2013. His completion percentage fell off a cliff to 60 percent last season, although he went deep more often (8.5 average depth of target) and dealt with the league's 10th-highest drop rate (4.7 percent). Rivers threw a career-high 21 interceptions last season, but the good news is that he'll have an impressive, deep supporting cast in 2017, led by Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Antonio Gates, Hunter Henry, Tyrell Williams and Melvin Gordon. Rivers is best viewed as a QB2, but there's some upside here."
Chiefs D/ST,"The Chiefs have built their recent defensive success on turnovers and scoring plays, and that was again the case when their D/ST finished fourth in fantasy points last season. The unit ranked first in interceptions (18), fumble recoveries (15), pass deflections (100) and touchdowns (eight). The Chiefs have intercepted 18-plus passes four of the past six seasons and ranked third with eight top-10 fantasy weeks in 2016. Most of Kansas City's defense returns in 2017, but Tamba Hali is now 33 years old and Derrick Johnson is recovering from a torn Achilles. Eric Berry, Justin Houston and Marcus Peters will need to carry the torch for this unit, which certainly gets a bump from returner Tyreek Hill, who scored three special teams touchdowns last season. A Week 1 trip to New England makes selecting the Chiefs' D/ST less appealing early on."
Texans D/ST,"Houston's defense allowed a league-low 4,821 yards last season, its fifth top-seven finish in the category over the past six years. That helped the team's J.J. Watt-less D/ST to a 12th-place finish despite ranking outside the top 20 in interceptions (11), forced fumbles (seven) and sacks (31). The Texans' D/ST had finished seventh or better in fantasy points four of the previous five years, so the returns of Watt and Kevin Johnson (who will help replace departed A.J. Bouye) figure to help the unit to a rebound season. Whitney Mercilus, Jadeveon Clowney, Brian Cushing and Benardrick McKinney also return from last year's loaded front seven."
Latavius Murray,"Murray, 27, joins the Vikings after spending the first four years of his career with Oakland. A 2013 sixth-round pick, he stepped into a full-time role in 2015 and went on to rack up 461 carries for 1,854 yards (4.0 YPC) and 18 touchdowns, as well as 74 receptions for 496 yards (5.6 YPR) during the 2015-16 seasons. Murray scored 12 touchdowns, thanks to 16 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season, both of which were fifth-most in the league. In Minnesota, Murray, who is 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, will work as power back and pass blocker alongside Jerick McKinnon and intriguing rookie Dalvin Cook. Murray may get first crack at early-down and goal-line work, but it's only a matter of time until the superior Cook takes full control. A Minnesota offensive line that allowed 1.9 yards before initial contact last season (second worst) only furthers the concern. Murray is unlikely to provide starting-caliber fantasy production throughout the season."
Vikings D/ST,"Minnesota's D/ST was fantasy's top-scoring unit last season, an impressive feat considering it ranked dead last in 2013. The Vikings ranked sixth or better in fumble recoveries (13), sacks (41), yards allowed (5,038), points allowed (307), touchdowns (seven) and top-10 fantasy weeks (eight). The loss of slot corner Captain Munnerlyn hurts a bit, but this a unit with talent on every level. That includes Harrison Smith, Xavier Rhodes, Eric Kendricks, Everson Griffen, Danielle Hunter, Linval Joseph and the ageless Terence Newman. The loss of Cordarrelle Patterson hurts this unit's potential for production from the return game. A Week 1 meeting with Drew Brees and the Saints is one to try to avoid."
Kevin White,"White was the seventh overall pick in the 2015 draft, but he's now appeared in only four of a possible 32 games because of injury over the past two years. After missing his entire rookie campaign, White showed progressive improvement as a sophomore this past season. He was targeted 35 times (8.75 per game), although a whopping 34 percent were off target. White will turn 25 this summer, which will be pretty late for a breakout, but he has a shot for a big role with Alshon Jeffery now in Philadelphia. White is 6-foot-3 and ran a 4.35 40-yard dash at the combine. His fantasy upside is enormous."
Robert Woods,"Woods is headed back home to Los Angeles after spending the first four years of his career in Buffalo. The 2013 second-round pick racked up 339 targets during his time with Buffalo, but never eclipsed 699 yards in a season. Woods struggled with injuries, missing at least two games during three of those four years. His size hasn't led to much work near the end zone; he has only 12 career receiving touchdowns and 24 end zone targets on his resume. Incredibly, he has produced only four top-10 fantasy weeks in his career. The 25-year-old is no more than a sneaky late-round option as a top target in a Rams offense unlikely to score very often."
Justin Tucker,"Tucker was ridiculously good in 2016, nailing all but one of his 39 field goal attempts. The only miss was blocked. He was perfect beyond 40 yards, including 10 of 10 from 50-plus yards. The average distance of his attempts was 41.9 yards, which was third highest in the NFL. Tucker's career 89.8 percent field goal conversion rate is the best all time, and he has connected on all 56 extra point attempts since the league moved the ball to the 15-yard line in 2015. Baltimore has attempted an NFL-high 352 field goals during the past decade. Tucker was fantasy's No. 2 kicker last season and has finished no lower than 11th since he entered the league in 2012. He's your best bet at the position, but you should not take a kicker before the last round of your draft."
Matt Bryant,"Bryant's career production has been quite the roller coaster, but it all led to the veteran pacing all kickers in fantasy points last season. Bryant has finished as a top-five fantasy kicker four of the past seven years but landed 12th or worse during the other three campaigns. He posted a top-10 fantasy week 13 times last season, which was four more than the next-closest kicker. He made 34 of 37 field goal attempts (91.9 percent) and, vaulted by Atlanta's terrific offense, converted an NFL-high 56 of his 57 extra point attempts. Atlanta's offense will come back to earth a bit this season, but Bryant will get enough work to post another strong fantasy campaign."
Stephen Gostkowski,"Gostkowski is further proof that reaching on a kicker is rarely a good idea. After finishing five straight seasons as a top-three fantasy kicker, including No. 1 each of the previous three years, Gostkowski plummeted to eighth in 2016. He converted 84.4 percent of his field goal attempts, which was his worst mark since 2012, and missed three extra point attempts. Gostkowski's efficiency dipped, but so did his volume; his 32 attempts were his lowest mark since 2010. Gostkowski is a quality kicker in one of the game's best offenses and figures to see more volume in 2017 (the Patriots rank third in the NFL with 336 field goal attempts during the past decade). He's an obvious bounce-back candidate."
Eric Ebron,"Ebron has finished as a top-15 fantasy tight end each of the past two seasons, but he's failed to meet the high expectations that come with being selected 10th overall in the draft. He's struggled with blocking, has missed eight games due to injury and has a position-high 16 drops in three seasons. Ebron scored just one touchdown last year, but he's hard to blame for that. He caught four of five end zone targets during his first two seasons but was limited to two end zone looks (he caught one) and no additional targets inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season. Ebron is only 23 years old, an athletically gifted 6-foot-4, 255-pound offensive weapon. He's a fringe TE1 target."
Adam Vinatieri,"Vinatieri's 87.1 percent field goal conversion rate last season is his lowest since 2012, but the average distance of his attempts (43.2 yards) was second highest in the league and, by far, the highest of his career. Considering the circumstances, Vinatieri's efficiency was outstanding. He finished third among kickers in fantasy points, and has finished top five during three of the past four seasons. Vinatieri turns 45 in December, but he's still going strong and working in a quality offense. He's a solid, high-floor option."
Dan Bailey,"Bailey converted only 27 (or 84.4 percent) of 32 field goal attempts last season, but his career mark of 89.5 percent is second best all time behind only Justin Tucker. Bailey is one of two kickers who haven't missed an extra point attempt during the past two seasons. The high efficiency has led to a lot of fantasy success. Bailey finished 10th at the position last year and has finished no lower than 11th since entering the league in 2011. Bailey is one of the NFL's best kickers, and the Cowboys' offense is good enough to allow him plenty of opportunities. He's a quality option for your team."
Rex Burkhead,"Burkhead was a 2013 sixth-round pick who played sparingly while primarily working as an H-back in Cincinnati during the past four seasons. Injuries forced him into a bigger role down the stretch last season, and he didn't disappoint. Burkhead averaged 4.6 YPC on 74 attempts, including 2.0 after contact, and he caught all but three of his 20 targets. Burkhead signed a one-year deal with New England and will compete for snaps with Mike Gillislee, Dion Lewis and James White. He's likely to be more valuable to New England than he is to fantasy owners."
Tyrod Taylor,"Taylor is back in Buffalo after a bizarre offseason that kicked off with a Week 17 benching. The Bills, of course, made the right decision to retain Taylor following a second consecutive standout season. Taylor's accuracy isn't great (off target on 20.2 percent of his throws last season), but he also had to deal with a poor supporting cast that created 4.2 yards after the catch (fourth lowest) and contributed to him being the league's most-sacked QB (42). Taylor more than makes up for suspect accuracy with his exceptional rushing ability; he paced all quarterbacks in carries, rushing yards and rushing scores last season. Taylor finished 13 of his 15 outings ranked 17th or better at the position in fantasy points. The loss of Sammy Watkins hurts, but Taylor's legs should help him sustain borderline top-10 fantasy production."
Cardinals D/ST,"The 2016 season was a disappointment for the Cardinals, but their D/ST still managed to finish third in fantasy points for the second year in a row. They ranked first in forced fumbles (21), sacks (48) and tackles for loss (122), and second in fumble recoveries (14) and fewest yards allowed (4,883). A lengthy list of offseason losses that includes Calais Campbell and Tony Jefferson certainly knocks Arizona down a few pegs, but this remains a solid group led by Chandler Jones, Patrick Peterson and Tyrann Mathieu."
Alvin Kamara,"Kamara may not have quite the statistical or athletic upside of some other top rookie backs, but he's solid and/or spectacular in nearly all areas. Kamara sports a healthy combination of size (5-foot-10, 214 pounds), power and speed, and his ability as a pass-catcher and returner will get him on the field early in his career. Multiple knee injuries, as well as character and fumble concerns, are the primary red flags facing the 21-year-old. Kamara posted the best vertical and broad jumps among backs during the combine. The third-round pick will begin his career in the 'Darren Sproles/Reggie Bush' role, with Mark Ingram and Adrian Peterson handling most of the carries and goal-line work. He's a worthwhile late-round target, but downgrade him in non-PPR."
Samaje Perine,"Perine was scooped up by Washington in the fourth round of April's draft. He lacks top-end speed and quickness, as reflected in his underwhelming combine production, but Perine is big (5-foot-11, 233 pounds) and powerful (position-high 30 bench press reps at the combine). He'll do his damage between the tackles, at the goal line and after initial contact. Perine was limited to 11 targets during his final season at Oklahoma, but to his credit, he caught 10 for 106 yards and a score. He has a shot at flex production, only if he's able to beat out Rob Kelley for early-down and goal-line work."
Patriots D/ST,"The Patriots benefited from an extremely light 2016 schedule, but their D/ST is one of only two units to rank top-10 in fantasy each of the past five years (Seattle). The Patriots allowed a league-low 250 points and forced 16 fumbles (seventh) last season. They ranked last in tackles for loss (60). New England added Stephon Gilmore and Lawrence Guy, but lost Logan Ryan, Jabaal Sheard and Chris Long during the offseason. Dont'a Hightower and Devin McCourty will again lead what should be a solid unit."
Matt Prater,"Prater finished fifth among kickers in fantasy points last season, and has now posted a top-nine campaign during three of the past five seasons. On the other hand, he finished 19th or worse the other two years and a lot of his 2016 damage came during a five-game stretch. Prater finished 10th or better during five games stretching from Week 9 to 14 but posted only one other weekly finish better than 13th. Prater's efficiency has been terrific during the past four years (88.4 percent) and he nailed all seven of his attempts from beyond 50 yards last season. He's a starting-caliber fantasy kicker but nothing more."
Dustin Hopkins,"Hopkins attempted a league-high 42 field goals last season but was able to convert only 34 (81 percent). The heavy volume allowed him the sixth-most fantasy points at the position. Hopkins' efficiency was better in 2015 (89.3 percent), but he attempted only 28 kicks and ranked 15th in fantasy points. The Redskins' high-scoring offense positions Hopkins for plenty of volume again this season, but the former sixth-round pick has shown to be no better than a pedestrian talent. He's a back-end fantasy starter."
Kenny Stills,"Stills enjoyed a breakout second season with Miami, but he's a lock for touchdown regression to the mean in 2017. Utilized primarily as a deep threat (14.4 average depth of target), Stills scored a touchdown on nine (or 21.4 percent) of his 42 receptions. He ranked sixth at the position in touchdowns, but was 56th in targets and 49th in end zone targets (six). On the plus side, despite working primarily as the third receiver, Stills was on the field for 90 percent of the team's pass plays. Stills' contract was extended during the offseason, but he will need to see more volume in order to repeat as a top-30 non-PPR receiver. That will be hard to achieve with DeVante Parker entering his third season and Julius Thomas now in the mix."
Jeremy Hill,"In his first three NFL seasons, Hill's number of carries have been 222, 223 and 222 and his rushing touchdowns have been nine, 13 and nine. While the volume has been consistent, the efficiency has not. Hill was terrific as a rookie, registering 5.1 YPC (sixth best), including 2.3 after contact (fifth). Over the past two seasons, he has averaged 3.7 YPC, including 1.5 after contact, both of which rank second-worst among 42 backs with at least 220 carries in that span. Hill has been a top-22 fantasy back each of his first three years in the NFL, but he has also been top 10 in carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line each season. He offers very little as a receiver, his effectiveness has dwindled and he's no longer the favorite for lead back duties following the selection of Joe Mixon in April's draft. Hill is no more than a late-round flier."
Marqise Lee,"Lee's injury woes have made it easy to forget that Jacksonville selected him 22 picks before it took Allen Robinson in the 2014 draft. Lee was limited to 52 receptions while sitting out nine games during his first two seasons but took a big step forward in 2016. Lee had to deal with 27.2 percent of the balls thrown his way qualifying as off target, but he averaged 13.5 yards per reception (35th), 5.6 of which came after the catch (14th). Lee has never posted a top-10 fantasy week but delivered seven top-30 weeks last year. Blake Bortles remains a problem, and the Jaguars should be able to run more with an improved defense, but Lee is good enough to warrant a late-round pick. "
Cooper Kupp,"Kupp was selected in the third round of April's draft. He has big time PPR upside as a player who dominated in a possession role at the collegiate level. Expect him to quickly nail down the Rams' slot gig. There's some late-round appeal here, though the Rams' low-scoring offense will limit his contributions. "
Panthers D/ST,"Over the past five years, Carolina's D/ST has finished 13th or worse three times and fourth or better twice. This was a mid-pack unit in 2016 that ranked top-four in interceptions (17), forced fumbles (18), sacks (47) and tackles for loss (100). Most of that was wiped out by Carolina allowing the seventh-most points (402) and 21st-most yards (5,756). Of those 402 points allowed, 54 percent came in six games against New Orleans (twice), Atlanta (twice), Oakland and Seattle. A rebound season is likely in the cards after the Panthers added Julius Peppers, Captain Munnerlyn and Mike Adams to a talented unit that also includes Luke Kuechly, Kawann Short, Shaq Thompson, Thomas Davis, Charles Johnson and James Bradberry. A Week 1 meeting with San Francisco makes this unit even more attractive."
Mason Crosby,"After posting back-to-back top-eight fantasy campaigns, Crosby has finished 16th or worse each of the past two years. Volume and efficiency are both culprits. Crosby totaled 70 field goal attempts during the 2013 and 2014 seasons, but 58 during the past two years. He ranks first in field goal attempts (328), but 36th in conversion rate (80.5 percent) among 41 kickers who have at least 100 attempts since he entered the league in 2007. Crosby is not a very good kicker, but Green Bay's strong offense has allowed him seven top-12 fantasy seasons, including six top-nine, during the past 10 years. You could do much worse at the position."
D'Onta Foreman,"At 6-foot, 233 pounds, Foreman is one of the biggest running backs entering the league this year. The 21-year-old is pretty quick and athletic for his size but may be limited to early-down and goal-line work at the pro level. Foreman carried the ball 323 times for 2,028 yards at Texas last season but was limited to seven receptions. He ran for negative yardage on only 9 percent of his carries. Similar to the likes of LeGarrette Blount and Jonathan Stewart, expect Foreman to settle in as an effective early-down and goal-line grinder. He won't have much standalone value as a rookie, but the third-round pick is an intriguing handcuff behind Lamar Miller. "
Shane Vereen,"Vereen tore his triceps twice last season, which limited him to 44 touches in five games. The 28-year-old passing-down specialist entered the year having finished top-six among backs in targets, receptions and receiving yards each of the previous two seasons. In fact, prior to 2016, Vereen had posted at least 68 targets, 47 receptions, 427 yards and three touchdowns in three consecutive seasons. Granted, he ran against a lot of nickel defenses, but Vereen has a serviceable career 4.3 YPC. He'll spend 2017 as the Giants' passing-down specialist behind Paul Perkins and is a solid late-round target in PPR."
Torrey Smith,"The Eagles signed Smith to a three-year deal with the hope that he'll return to the player he was during his four-year tenure in Baltimore. During that time, the 2011 second-round pick didn't miss a single game and averaged 106 targets, 53 receptions, 898 yards and 7.5 touchdowns per season. Incredibly, he finished a season no better than 22nd and no worse than 31st among wide receivers in fantasy points. Smith then signed with San Francisco, but the wheels fell off in the Bay Area. He caught a grand total of 53 balls for 930 yards and 7 touchdowns in 28 games with the 49ers. Smith figures to operate as the team's top deep threat and has an easier path to targets with Jordan Matthews now with the Rams."
Jaguars D/ST,"The Jaguars' D/ST has finished eight of the past nine seasons 21st or worse in fantasy points, which includes a 20th-place finish in 2016. Jacksonville finished dead last in interceptions (seven) and 31st in passes defensed (53), but showed well with a ninth-place finish in tackles for loss (93) and the sixth-fewest yards allowed (5,147). Despite this franchise's recent struggles, there's reason to expect a big step forward in 2017. This defense is now officially loaded, following the offseason acquisitions of Calais Campbell, Barry Church and A.J. Bouye. They join stars Malik Jackson, Paul Posluszny, Telvin Smith and Jalen Ramsey on a unit also stocked with intriguing prospects, including Dante Fowler Jr., Myles Jack and Yannick Ngakoue. The Jags face Houston in Week 1, which adds to this unit's draft-day appeal."
Bengals D/ST,"Cincinnati's D/ST has been a top-nine unit five of the past eight seasons, but has also posted a finish of 19th or worse two of the past three years. The Bengals ranked fourth in the league in interceptions (17) and allowed the eighth-fewest points (315), but fell to 19th in sacks (33) and ranked near the basement of the league in forced fumbles (six) for the third straight year. They have registered only two touchdowns in the past three years. With Geno Atkins, Carlos Dunlap, Vontaze Burfict, Vincent Rey, Adam Jones and George Iloka, this is a defense with talent on every level. William Jackson (first round) and Andrew Billings (fourth) will also play pivotal roles after missing their entire rookie season due to injuries. This unit is a good bet for a bounce back."
Jamaal Charles,"Charles owns a 5.5 YPC during his nine-year career, which is the league's top individual mark during the Super Bowl era. Although Charles has been an electric playmaker, his durability continues to derail his career. Charles has appeared in only eight games over the past two seasons and has missed at least 11 games during three of the past six years. Now 30, Charles heads to Denver where he will compete for touches with C.J. Anderson and Devontae Booker. It's possible he emerges into a 15-touch back, but the more likely scenario is a situational role. That would limit him to occasional flex value."
Cairo Santos,"Following an uninspiring rookie season, Santos has settled in as a solid kicker and decent fantasy asset. Santos is one of only four kickers who have posted top-12 fantasy campaigns each of the past two seasons. He nailed a career-high 88.6 percent of his field goal attempts in 2016, although the average distance of those kicks (35.7) was near the basement of the league, and down significantly from 2015 (39.8). Kansas City's conservative offense has allowed Santos the league's third-most attempts during the past two years (72) and we should expect more of the same in 2017."
Andy Dalton,"Dalton can't seem to be able to put together consecutive strong fantasy seasons, but a lot of his 2016 woes can be traced to forces out of his control. The Bengals changed offensive coordinators, overhauled the receiving corps behind A.J. Green, and Gio Bernard, Tyler Eifert and Green combined to miss 20 games. Dalton still managed to finish 12th at the position in fantasy points. He threw a career-low 18 touchdowns, but rushed for a career-high 184 yards and four touchdowns. Dalton was more conservative, more accurate and cut down even further on interceptions. He is a prime bounce-back candidate, especially following the additions of John Ross and Joe Mixon, but figures to max out as a streaming option."
Jason Witten,"Witten is now 35 years old and will return for his 15th professional season. The NFL's iron man has appeared in every single one of the Cowboys' games since sitting out an Oct. 12, 2003, game against the Eagles. Witten no longer sports much upside (nine top-10 fantasy weeks in the past two seasons) and 2016 marked the first season since his rookie year in which he didn't finish as a top-12 fantasy tight end. Witten has scored three touchdowns in each of the last two years, and his four end zone targets ranked 21st at the position last season. He's a solid TE2 in all formats, but he should be downgraded in non-PPR."
DeAndre Washington,"Oakland selected Washington in the fifth round of last year's draft following his highly productive and efficient stint at Texas Tech. The 5-foot-8, 204-pound scatback impressed with 582 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 104 touches as a rookie. He averaged 5.4 YPC (sixth), including 2.6 after contact (fourth). The 24-year-old will compete with Jalen Richard for reps behind Marshawn Lynch this season. He's nothing more than a late-round handcuff target. "
John Ross,"The star of the 2017 NFL combine, the 5-foot-10, 188-pound Ross ran a 4.22 40-yard dash, which beat the previous all-time record of 4.24 (Chris Johnson). Ross is an undersized lid-lifter whose speed and big-play ability led the Bengals to select him in with the ninth-overall pick of April's draft. Ross did a lot more than just catch deep balls during his final season at Washington. In fact, his 11.6 average depth of target is near league average, and he caught a touchdown on 17 of his 81 receptions. Ross may initally struggle for snaps behind A.J. Green, Brandon LaFell and Tyler Boyd, but he'll be utilized as a deep threat, kick returner and ball carrier. "
Cole Beasley,"Beasley posted career highs in targets, receptions and receiving yards last season but was limited to three end zone targets and finished 33rd among wide receivers in fantasy points. His 6.6 average depth of target was sixth lowest at the position, which helped him to a position-best 77 percent catch rate. Beasley's targets were consistent but not nearly high enough, as he handled between four and six targets in 13 of 17 games. Considering his usage in Dallas' run-heavy offense, we've likely seen the 28-year-old's fantasy ceiling. Downgrade him in non-PPR."
James Conner,DeAngelo Williams was fantasy's top-scoring running back during the weeks missed by Le'Veon Bell in both 2015 and 2016. Conner - a 2017 third-round pick - has taken over for Williams as Bell's primary handcuff. He's worth a late-round flier and stash.
Dion Lewis,"A torn ACL suffered midway through the 2015 season cost Lewis all but seven regular-season games last season. He handled 22.0 snaps per game down the stretch, but his contributions were limited by the presence and success of LeGarrette Blount and James White. Lewis racked up 377 yards and no touchdowns on 81 touches, which was a massive drop from the 622 yards and four touchdowns on 85 touches he posted in seven games in 2015. Lewis is only 26 years old, but he's extremely injury-prone and will need to fend off White and newcomers Mike Gillislee and Rex Burkhead for snaps. New England's high-scoring offense makes Lewis a worthwhile draft pick, but he'll be a risky flex play."
Tyler Lockett,"Lockett was a popular breakout target in 2016 fantasy drafts and, although he was a bit over-drafted, the hype surrounding his talent is certainly legitimate. Dealing with a PCL injury during most of the first half of last season, Lockett was limited to one touchdown and two top-30 fantasy weeks on the year. He averaged a healthy 9.3 yards per target (13th) and, Week 17 injury aside, finished the year strongly as a top-35 fantasy wide receiver during Weeks 10-16. Lockett's recovery from a broken fibula and tibia needs to be monitored, but the 24-year-old playmaker will eventually return as one Russell Wilson's top targets in a suddenly pass-first offense. Lockett has the look of a good late-round, post-hype target."
Austin Hooper,"It's rare for a rookie tight end to make a fantasy impact, so it's hardly a surprise that Hooper finished 2016 with only 19 receptions. The Stanford product appeared in 14 games and averaged 27.3 snaps per game. Although Jacob Tamme's shoulder injury forced the team to use a committee at the position, Atlanta tight ends still combined for 788 yards and 10 touchdowns. Hooper is expected to play a much larger role in his second season and will thus be responsible for a hefty share of those looks. The 2016 third-round pick will make for an intriguing late-round flier in Atlanta's high-scoring offense."
J.J. Nelson,"Nelson enjoyed a bit of a breakout during the second half of 2016, but he benefited from quite a few splash plays and caught only 34 passes on the season. After playing sparingly out of the gate, Nelson was nearly an every-down player and racked up 9.7 targets per game during the final three games of the season. His 16.9 average depth target was highest among players targeted at least 50 times, but he caught only 47 percent of the balls thrown his way (fifth worst) and dropped five balls. The 2015 fifth-round pick is extremely undersized at 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, but sports game-breaking 4.26 wheels. Expect him to settle in as a situational deep threat but an unreliable fantasy receiver in 2017."
Jalen Richard,"A relative unknown last spring, Richard went undrafted out of Southern Miss but ended up latching on with Oakland. Operating in a committee with Latavius Murray and DeAndre Washington, Richard carried the ball 83 times for 491 yards and a touchdown. He averaged 5.9 YPC (second), including 2.7 after contact (third). A two-way asset, he ranked top-35 among backs in both rushing and receiving yards on 112 touches. Oakland upgraded from Murray to Marshawn Lynch on early downs, which means Richard is again positioned for nothing more than change-of-pace duties."
Carson Wentz,"Wentz was fairly impressive by rookie quarterback standards, but he was far from a quality fantasy asset.  He posted one top-10 fantasy week, finished 18th or worse 10 times and ended the year 24th at the position, which was lowest among passers who appeared in all 16 games. Wentz completed 62 percent of his passes, but dealt with 31 drops (second most). Wentz's 6.2 yards per attempt was fourth lowest in the league, but his horrendous supporting cast generated 4.8 yards after the catch (seventh lowest). With Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith added to a unit that also includes Jordan Matthews and Zach Ertz, Wentz's arsenal is now NFL caliber. He's an obvious candidate for a second-year leap."
Giants D/ST,"The Giants were the biggest riser among D/ST units from 2015 to 2016, jumping 23 spots to fifth. They allowed 284 points (second fewest), intercepted 17 passes (fourth most), racked up 97 passes defensed (second most) and scored four touchdowns (sixth most). The Giants used an extremely impressive free-agent class in order to make the big leap, with Janoris Jenkins, Olivier Vernon and Damon Harrison each playing a pivotal role. Linebacker remains a problem spot, but with the aforementioned trio, as well as Jason Pierre-Paul, Landon Collins, Eli Apple and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, this unit is poised for another strong campaign."
Devontae Booker,"Booker began his rookie season as a backup but was vaulted into lead-back duties following a season-ending injury to C.J. Anderson. The fourth-round pick did not perform well. He averaged 3.5 YPC, 1.7 of which came after contact. The jury is far from out on Booker, but he's already 25 years old and will open 2017 behind Anderson and newcomer Jamaal Charles. Booker drew Jeremy Langford comparisons out of Utah as a potential three-down back with a good size/speed profile, but, similar to his comp, his rookie season didn't paint a very optimistic picture."
Allen Hurns,"Hurns was never a good bet to repeat his 10-touchdown 2015 campaign, but regression to the mean aside, poor quarterback play and a hamstring injury derailed his 2016. He had more drops (six) than touchdowns (three) in 11 games, and his 47 percent catch rate was third worst at the position. On the plus side, including only games in which he was active, Hurns has averaged an 18 percent target share during each of his three NFL seasons. Even during Marqise Lee's emergence last season, Hurns remained heavily involved. He averaged 5.7 yards after catch last year (11th). The 6-foot-3 25-year-old is still worth a look late in 2017 drafts."
Eagles D/ST,"The 2016 Eagles started the season with six straight top-10 fantasy weeks, but managed only two during their final 10 games. Philadelphia's D/ST continues to rely heavily on touchdowns, ranking top-three in the category each of the past three seasons. The Eagles ranked near mid-pack in most D/ST-relevant categories and the five touchdowns helped them to a sixth-place finish in fantasy points. The Eagles added Chris Long and Derek Barnett, and upgraded from Bennie Logan to Timmy Jernigan, which only adds to talented defense led by Fletcher Cox, Brandon Graham, Jordan Hicks, Nigel Bradham and Malcolm Jenkins. Cornerback is a massive concern, however, and figures to hold this unit back in 2017."
Eli Manning,"Manning has started 199 consecutive games tracing back to midway through his rookie season in 2004. Despite all that volume, Manning finished better than 10th at the position in fantasy points once during the past decade (2011). In what was a very disappointing 2016 season, he finished 21st for the second time in four years. Despite his receivers generating 5.3 yards after the catch (ninth most), Manning's yards per attempt dipped to 6.7 (ninth lowest). He managed a grand total of two top-10 fantasy weeks. Manning's 2017 prospects are helped by the additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram, but it's hard to trust a 36-year-old quarterback coming off one of his worst seasons in an offense that finished 23rd in touchdowns."
T.J. Yeldon,"Injuries, pedestrian efficiency and a poor offense have been among the variables that have hindered Yeldon from emerging as an NFL feature back. The 2013 second-round pick shared the Jaguars' backfield with Chris Ivory and averaged a measly 3.6 YPC over 130 attempts last season. On the plus side, per Pro Football Focus, Yeldon forced a missed tackle on 0.18 of his attempts, which was seventh best among backs with at least 100 carries. Yeldon also caught 50 passes, which ranked 10th at the position. Yeldon is only 23 years old, but his chances of breaking out in Jacksonville took a major hit when the team selected Leonard Fournette fourth overall in April's draft. He'll be no more than a passing-down complement in 2017 and has little fantasy value."
Charles Sims,"A stint on injured reserve limited Sims to seven games last season, but he returns as the team's primary passing-down back this season. Back in 2015, Sims ranked fourth at the position in receiving yards and caught four touchdowns. He also dominated on the ground, albeit against nickel defenses, averaging 4.9 YPC (eighth). Sims has posted only three top-10 fantasy weeks over the past two years and  loses value in non-PPR formats. With Doug Martin suspended for three games, expect Sims to play a slightly expanded role alongside Jacquizz Rodgers early on."
Carson Palmer,"Following an explosive 2015 campaign, Palmer unsurprisingly came back to earth in 2016, but he was better than he's given credit for. In fact, the Arizona offense averaged 3.0 touchdowns per game, which was sixth highest in the NFL and only a slight step down from 2015 (3.1). Palmer's efficiency was down across the board, but some of that can be traced to John Brown's health issues and Michael Floyd's various struggles. Palmer, now 37, is entering what might be his final NFL season, but with an improved and healthier supporting cast that includes superstar David Johnson, he's a sneaky bet for a top-10 campaign."
Cameron Brate,"Brate spent a few years buried on the Bucs' depth chart after going undrafted in 2014, but he finally got his chance to flourish following last year's release of Austin Seferian-Jenkins. Brate took the opportunity and ran, scoring a position-high eight touchdowns en route to posting the seventh-most fantasy points at the position. Brate offers little as a blocker and after the catch (his 2.6 yards-after-catch average ranked last at the position), but he was kept busy downfield (9.8 average depth of target ranked third) and near the goal line. Following the selection of O.J. Howard in the first round of April's draft, Brate's role will surely be reduced in 2017. He's a fringe TE2."
Wil Lutz,"Lutz went undrafted and came out of nowhere to win the Saints' kicker job last season. He went on to post seven top-10 fantasy weeks and finished seventh at the position in fantasy points. The production can be traced more to volume than effectiveness. The Saints ranked 12th in the league with 34 field goal attempts last season but sit 31st in the category during the past decade (278). Lutz made 28 (or 82.4 percent) of those kicks and all but one of his 50 extra points attempts (second most in the NFL). History suggests Lutz won't handle as many attempts this season, but it's possible the 23-year-old's effectiveness improves in his second season."
Jamaal Williams,Williams is expected to take over for James Starks as the Packers primary No. 2 tailback this season. He'll give Ty Montgomery an occasional break and makes for an intriguing handcuff. 
Breshad Perriman,"Perriman has yet to break out since being selected in the first round of the 2015 draft. A PCL injury cost him his entire rookie campaign, and he was limited to 66 targets last season. Perriman sports an absurd size/speed combo, standing 6-foot-2, 218 pounds with 4.24 wheels. Working as a situational deep threat last season, Perriman posted a 14.0 average depth of target (10th best) but caught only half of his targets (11th worst) and dropped six balls. His 9.1 percent drop rate was worst in the NFL. Perriman is only 23 years old and ticketed for a slightly bigger role behind Mike Wallace and Jeremy Maclin. He has a massive ceiling and is thus worth a late-round flier."
Kenny Golladay,Golladay is the favorite to take over for Anquan Boldin as the Lions' No. 3 wide receiver. The big-bodied (6-4/218) third-round rookie is the Lions biggest receiver and thus likely to be busy near the goal line.
Chris Boswell,"Boswell was fantasy's No. 22 scoring kicker and was limited to three top-10 fantasy weeks last season, but there's reason to expect a lead forward in 2017. An abdomen injury cost him a game, but he connected on 84 percent of his field goal attempts on the season. The 26-year-old has missed one extra point attempt during the past two seasons and was a perfect 36-of-36 in 2016. He never has missed a postseason field goal attempt (15 of 15) and sports an impressive 90.3 conversion rate on his 72 career attempts. He was fantasy's No. 13 kicker while playing only 12 games in 2013. Boswell is a strong bet for a boost in attempts this season and will benefit from a quality Pittsburgh offense."
C.J. Fiedorowicz,"The Texans ranked bottom-three in the NFL in tight end targets in 2014 and 2015, but jumped to second in the category last season. No one benefited more than Fiedorowicz, who more than tripled his previous career-highs in targets, receptions, yardage and touchdowns. He racked up eight end zone targets (seventh-most) and finished 17th at the position in fantasy points. Fiedorowicz's efficiency wasn't very good (five drops, 63 percent catch rate, 6.5 yards per target), but some of that can be blamed on poor quarterback play. Fiedorowicz is a fine TE2 but has little upside with Tom Savage and/or rookie Deshaun Watson under center."
Devin Funchess,"Funchess seemingly entered his second NFL season as a viable threat to Kelvin Benjamin for the team's No. 1 wide receiver gig. It never materialized. The 2015 second-round pick caught only half of his 56 targets, although he averaged 16.1 YPR (eighth) and Cam Newton's accuracy issues led to 28.6 percent of those passes registering as off target (sixth highest). Funchess will now enter the ever-so-important third year of his career at the age of 22 and with the benefit of a 6-foot-4, 225-pound frame. Funchess' pedestrian 2016 campaign is a concern, but he's a candidate for a larger role in 2017."
Will Fuller V,"Fuller's rookie season wasn't particularly impressive, but his 47-630-2 line wasn't terribly far off preseason expectations. Fuller's 13.5 yards per catch was obviously a letdown for a field stretcher with 4.32 wheels who averaged 20.3' at Notre Dame in 2015. The first-round pick's 15.5-yard average depth of target ranked fourth in the NFL, but he was limited to a poor 6.9 yards per target. Fuller was on the field for 92 percent of Houston's pass plays and averaged 6.5 targets per game during the 14 games he was active. Fuller is a candidate for a second-year leap, but Houston's shaky quarterback situation is sure to be a nuisance."
Titans D/ST,"The Titans may be a team on the rise, but their D/ST hasn't posted a finish better than 16th since 2008. That includes a bottom-10 finish each of the past three years. In 2016, Tennessee forced four fumbles (dead last) and allowed 5,720 yards (13th most). The Titans did accrue 40 sacks (sixth most), though. Johnathan Cyprien, Logan Ryan and Adoree' Jackson were acquired during the offseason and fill out a pretty solid secondary. 'Solid' could also be applied to the team's front seven, which includes The Jaguars' D/ST has finished eight of the past nine seasons 21st or worse in fantasy points, which includes a 20th-place finish in 2016. Jurrell Casey, Derrick Morgan and Avery Williamson. Expect, you guessed it, a 'solid' 2017 from this unit."
Caleb Sturgis,"Sturgis beat out Cody Parkey for the Eagles' kicker job last season, and went on to enjoy a breakout 2016 campaign. He attempted 41 field goals (second most in the league) and converted 35 (85.4 percent). Sturgis was terrific from short range, connecting on all 24 attempts under 40 yards. He missed six of 17 tries from 40-plus. He ended up fourth at the position in fantasy points -- the first top-10 finish of his career. Sturgis is a pedestrian -- at best -- talent, and will lose opportunities if Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith help the Eagles' offense find the end zone more often in 2017. Sturgis is a good bet to take a step back, and is thus a fringe fantasy starter."
Mohamed Sanu,"The Atlanta offense ranked second in total offense last season, so Sanu's 59-653-4 line is certainly underwhelming, considering he was one of the Falcons' top offseason signings. Limited by his slot role, Sanu's 8.0 average depth of target was near the basement of the league, but he caught 75 percent of his targets (sixth). Sanu has posted one top-10 fantasy week over the past two years and 16 top-30 fantasy weeks in his five-year career. That's not good. Sanu will return as a complementary target and is worth no more than a late-round flier."
Taylor Gabriel,"Getting waived by the Browns is often a bad sign for a player's prospects, but that didn't stop Gabriel from exploding onto the fantasy scene in Atlanta last year. Gabriel was a situational player throughout the year (he was on the field for 51 percent of the pass plays when active), but his targets and, in turn, his production went way up in the second half. Gabriel's best fantasy week was 58th during Weeks 1-7, but he managed six top-30 weeks during his next seven outings. On the year, Gabriel averaged 11.5 yards per target (second) and 7.8 yards after catch (first). Atlanta's offense is going to come back to earth this year, and Gabriel will follow, especially considering he didn't see more than six targets in a single game last year. He's likely to be picked too early in your draft."
Tavon Austin,"Austin exploded for 10 all-purpose touchdowns and finished 27th among wide receivers in fantasy points in 2015 (19th in non-PPR).  Despite playing nearly the same role last year, he scored 52 fewer fantasy points and ended up 53rd (56th in non-PPR) at the position. Austin actually set career highs in receptions and receiving yards last year, but his rushing production plummeted and proved to be the difference. Austin's inefficiencies were also a big issue, as his 4.8 yards-per-target mark ranked dead last among 90 qualified wideouts. He also ranked third in drops (eight). Austin's 2017 prospects will depend on QB Jared Goff's progression and new head coach Sean McVay's ability to maximize his skill set."
Robby Anderson,"Anderson went undrafted out of Temple last season, but quickly latched on with the Jets and made the team after leading the NFL in receiving yards (264) and touchdown receptions (three) during the preseason. Injuries and Chan Gailey's wide-receiver-heavy offense forced the 6-foot-3, 190-pound Anderson into a significant role early on. He was on the field for 90 percent of the team's pass plays from Week 4 on, but was 58th at the position in fantasy points during the span. Anderson's 16.3 average depth of target was second highest in the NFL. Gailey is gone, but so is Brandon Marshall, which leaves Anderson with a shot to earn a starting role. A second-year leap is possible, but New York's shaky quarterback situation figures to be a major roadblock. "
Julius Thomas,"Thomas was a fourth-round pick way back in 2011, but injuries have limited him to 53 (or 47 percent) of 112 possible games. He was traded to Miami during the offseason following a failed two-year stint in Jacksonville in which he missed 11 games and scored a total of nine touchdowns. Thomas ranked in the bottom-five at the position in catch rate and yards per target during both seasons with the Jaguars. In Miami, Thomas is reunited with Adam Gase, who was the offensive coordinator when he scored 12 touchdowns in both 2013 and 2014 with Denver. Thomas turns 29 years old this year and is a terrific athlete, but it's hard to trust one of the most injury-prone players in the league, especially in a run-heavy offense. He's a boom/bust TE2."
Jonathan Williams,"Williams, a fifth-round pick last year, was limited to 83 snaps and carried the ball 27 times for 94 yards and one touchdown as a rookie. Following the departure of Mike Gillislee, Williams is the current favorite to begin the 2017 season as LeSean McCoy's primary handcuff. The Arkansas product won't have standalone value, but could push past 15 carries per game in the event of a McCoy injury. He's a worthwhile late-round flier."
Coby Fleener,"Expectations were sky-high for Fleener after he signed a five-year, $36 million contract with the Saints last offseason. The results did not match the hype. Despite appearing in all 16 games, Fleener found the end zone only three times and ranked 15th at the position in fantasy points. Fleener's 9.6 average depth of target was fifth-highest at the position and his 64 percent catch rate 11th lowest. It's possible the 27-year-old takes a leap forward in his second year with Drew Brees, but he'll need to see more than the 4.9 targets he averaged last season. Fleener is no more than a post-hype flier."
Jared Cook,"Cook joins the Raiders after playing well during his first and only season in Green Bay. The 2009 third-round pick was limited by injury to 10 regular-season games last season. He scored only one touchdown, but stretched the field with a 10.1 average depth of target (second highest among TEs). He also ranked top 10 at the position in yards after catch (4.9) and has ranked top 11 in yards per reception in seven consecutive seasons. Cook is now 30 years old, and, although he's the Oakland tight end to own in fantasy, he'll be hard-pressed to land consistent snaps and targets with blocker Lee Smith and third-year Clive Walford also in the picture."
Evan Engram,"Engram is 6-foot-3, 234 pounds with 10-inch hands and ran a position-best 4.42 40-yard dash at the combine. The 22-year-old is a terrific athlete with exceptional speed and quickness. He will excel as a seam stretcher for the Giants (who selected him No. 23 overall) and with the ball in his hands, but simply won't be asked to block much. Engram's 65 receptions and 926 yards were most among FBS tight ends who attended the combine. During each of coach Ben McAdoo's three seasons with the Giants, at least 19 percent of the team's targets have gone to the tight end. Expect Engram to be on the field often when the Giants are passing this season, which provides him plenty of TE2 appeal."
Antonio Gates,"Gates scored seven touchdowns last season, which was the exact number he needed to tie Tony Gonzalez for most all-time scores at the position. Gates missed two games, but still posted his 13th consecutive top-13 fantasy campaign. Gates will return for a 15th season, but concern about his effectiveness is fair after he posted his lowest catch rate (58 percent) and yards per target (6.0) and highest drop rate (6.6 percent) of the past decade in 2016. Gates is now 37 years old and a sure bet to lose targets with Keenan Allen healthy, Mike Williams in the mix and second-year TE Hunter Henry on the rise."
Chargers D/ST,"The Chargers are on the rise and their defense should be a big part of their emergence in 2017. The unit includes one of the game's best run stuffers in Brandon Mebane, a terrific pass-rushing duo in Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, a solid set of linebackers in Jatavis Brown and Denzel Perryman and one of the game's best cornerback duos in Jason Verrett and Casey Hayward. New defensive coordinator Gus Bradley only figures to improve on a unit that finished 10th in fantasy points last season. The Chargers' defense tied for the NFL lead with 18 interceptions, ranked second in tackles for loss (108) and scored five touchdowns in 2016. Expect this young, talented unit to take another step forward in 2017."
Sebastian Janikowski,"Once among the best in the game, Janikowski has settled in as an average kicker during the past few seasons. The average distance of his kicks has dipped in recent years, and his 79.6 percent conversion rate during the past four years ranks last among 33 kickers who have at least 60 attempts during the span. The good news is that Janikowski now benefits from a quality Oakland offense. After three straight seasons finishing outside the top-20 fantasy kickers, Janikowski jumped to 12th last year. He's a borderline starting-caliber fantasy option."
Joe Flacco,"Seemingly out of nowhere, Baltimore decided to roll with one of the league's pass-heaviest offenses last season. It led to Flacco easily posting career highs in pass attempts (672) and passing yards (4,317). Still, Flacco struggled to a 20-to-15 TD/INT mark and finished 20th at the position in fantasy points, his worst finish in a season in which he played 16 games. In fact, his best season-long finish is 10th (2010). Flacco's accuracy was solid last season (15.5 percent off-target rate), but he was very conservative (7.4 average depth of throw) and averaged fewer than 6.8 yards per attempt for the second straight year. He is a back-end QB2 with little upside."
Chris Hogan,"The wide-receiver-needy Patriots signed Hogan as a restricted free agent last offseason. The ex-Bill was on the field for 83 percent of the Patriots' pass plays during the 15 games he was active, but managed to average only 3.6 targets per game. A boom-or-bust producer, Hogan averaged a position-high 12.6 yards per target. He caught 70 percent of his targets (18th) despite a 13.6-yard average depth of target (15th). Targets were obviously already an issue for Hogan, and he's a strong candidate for even fewer in 2017, with Brandin Cooks added to the mix and Rob Gronkowski back to full health. Hogan is more of a handcuff than he is a standalone fantasy asset."
Joe Williams,Williams was hand-picked by Kyle Shanahan in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL draft. He will be in for a big workload in the event of another Carlos Hyde injury and is thus worth a late flier.
Lance Dunbar,"Dunbar heads to Los Angeles after playing sparingly as a passing-down specialist during five years in Dallas. The 27-year-old has never managed more than 21 receptions in a season, but Chris Thompson registered 49 catches playing the same role in Sean McVay's offense last season. Dunbar will struggle for fantasy relevance behind Todd Gurley in an offense that is unlikely to find the end zone much, so he's worth no more than a late-round flier. Downgraded him in non-PPR."
Mike Williams,"Williams was selected by the Chargers with the seventh pick in this year's draft. He caught 98 passes for 1,361 yards and 11 touchdowns during his final season at Clemson. Williams isn't particularly fast, but he's a tough 6-foot-3, 218 pounds and will spend his NFL days making plays on the perimeter. Williams can produce on all levels of the field and will be a go-to weapon near the end zone. The Chargers are loaded with offensive weapons, but Williams is a good bet to see the field often on a team that should score often. He's a solid flex target."
Malcolm Mitchell,"Mitchell was a 2016 fourth-round pick, and, despite barely playing early on, he made a fantasy impact down the stretch. Mitchell handled 15 targets total during Weeks 1-10 before averaging 5.2 per game afterward. The rookie posted four consecutive top-26 fantasy weeks during Weeks 11-14 before seeing his usage dip down the stretch. Mitchell isn't a spectacular athlete but was effective in a small sample of work as a rookie. A second-year leap is possible, but targets will be hard to find following New England's acquisition of Brandin Cooks. Mitchell, who turns 25 this summer, is no more than a late-round lottery ticket."
Marquise Goodwin,"Goodwin was a third-round pick in 2013 and joins San Francisco after spending four years as a situational deep threat in Buffalo. Goodwin posted a 43 percent catch rate (second lowest) last season, although a position-high 37.3 percent of balls thrown his way were off target. That can partially be attributed to his 14.9-yard average depth of target (fifth highest). Goodwin posted two top-10 fantasy weeks but no additional finishes better than 41st. The speedy Goodwin is currently positioned as the 49ers' No. 2 perimeter target opposite Pierre Garcon, but he's a one-trick pony in a bad offense. He has little fantasy appeal in 12-team leagues."
Sam Bradford,"Bradford is giving Alex Smith a run for his money as the league's most-conservative quarterback. Bradford's 6.4 average depth of throw was lowest in the NFL last season and he's ranked near the basement of the league in the category during each of his past three seasons. Bradford made up for some of the conservative play with terrific accuracy last season. He completed an NFL-record 71.6 percent of his throws, was off target on 12 percent (third best) and was intercepted only five times. Bradford's supporting cast is actually pretty solid (Stefon Diggs, Adam Thielen, Kyle Rudolph, Dalvin Cook and potentially Laquon Treadwell), but his conservative play, shaky durability and lack of rushing production will again limit him to fringe QB2 numbers."
Blake Bortles,"Bortles has posted back-to-back top-nine fantasy campaigns, but it's hard to recommend a player who has been so reliant on volume and struggled so badly with efficiency. Compared to his breakout 2015 campaign, Bortles actually attempted 19 more passes in 2016, but threw for 523 fewer yards and tossed 12 fewer touchdowns. He completed 59 percent of his passes for the third straight season (sixth worst), was off target on 19 percent of his throws (ninth worst) and averaged 6.2 yards per attempt (fifth worst). Bortles was a top-10 fantasy quarterback during 63 percent of his starts in 2015, but only 25 percent in 2016. The Jaguars' much-improved defense and the addition of Leonard Fournette is only going to limit Bortles' volume, making him a good bet for a dip in fantasy production in 2017."
Ravens D/ST,"Baltimore's D/ST finished eighth in fantasy points and posted eight top-10 weeks (third most) last season. In addition, the Ravens have topped the NFL in blocked kicks each of the past two seasons (four in 2016). They also were tied for tops in the league in interceptions (18) last season, but ranked in the bottom half of the league in forced fumbles (14) and sacks (31). Baltimore added Tony Jefferson, Brandon Carr and Marlon Humphrey to a now-loaded secondary that already included Jimmy Smith, Eric Weddle and Lardarius Webb. The front seven isn't quite as impressive, but includes talent in the form of C.J. Mosley, Brandon Williams, Tyus Bowser and 34-year-old Terrell Suggs."
Nick Novak,Novak is a solid NFL kicker and a big boost in volume helped him to the ninth-most fantasy points at the position last season. The Texans ranked second in field goal attempts (41) and converted only 44 percent of their red zone visits into touchdowns last season (second lowest in the league). Houston also sits second during the past decade (338) in field goal attempts. Novak's 86.0 percent field goal conversion rate ranks 12th among 42 kickers with at least 60 attempts during the past six years. Novak is a fringe top-12 fantasy kicker.
Chris Conley,"An intriguing 2015 third-round pick as a result of his size and speed combination, Conley has yet to live up to his pedigree. He stands at 6-3, 205 pounds and sports 4.35 wheels. Conley was on the field for 84 percent of the Chiefs' pass plays but handled only 4.1 targets per game in 2016. Conley ended the regular season with the unfortunate distinction of having the most targets (66), receptions (44) and receiving yards (530) among wide receivers who failed to score a single touchdown. Conley is only 24, so there's still hope here, but he will enter 2017 behind Travis Kelce, Jeremy Maclin and Tyreek Hill in terms of priority in the passing game."
Laquon Treadwell,"Treadwell was the consensus top wide receiver in the 2016 NFL draft, and the Vikings scooped him up with the 23rd overall selection. The Ole Miss product never truly got rolling and played a grand total of 76 offensive snaps. The good news is that Treadwell is one of the league's youngest players at 21. He was dominant during his final collegiate season, hauling in 82 passes for 1,153 yards and 11 touchdowns in 13 games. Kyle Rudolph, Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen will remain big factors in the passing game next season, but Treadwell is a near lock to play a significantly larger role in his second season. He's an obvious post-hype target."
Carlos Henderson,"Henderson was selected by Broncos in the third round of April's draft following a monster 2016 breakout campaign at Louisiana Tech. The 22-year-old registered 1,668 yards and 21 touchdowns from scrimmage while adding 805 yards and a pair of scores on 25 kick returns. Henderson was dominant with the ball in his hands and posted a dominant 11.8 yards per target. Henderson is on the small side (5-foot-11, 199 pounds), but he's fast, quick, versatile and sure-handed. He has experience lining up all over the field and can immediately contribute as a returner and likely as Denver's No. 3 receiver. He's a sneaky late-round target."
Tyler Boyd,"Boyd entered the league as a 21-year-old second-round pick, but injuries and free-agent departures forced him into a hefty rookie-season role. Boyd averaged 44.3 snaps per game but was limited to two top-30 fantasy weeks. In fact, his best outing was 12th in Week 11. The former Pitt star will enter 2017 positioned for a larger target share, but his fantasy value will be capped a bit by his role as a short-area slot receiver. Additionally, A.J. Green, Tyler Eifert, Brandon LaFell and newcomer John Ross figure to work as Andy Dalton's top targets. Boyd is a worthwhile late-round flier in deep PPR leagues."
Terrance Williams,"Williams has been on the field for 84 percent of the Cowboys' pass plays since entering the league via the third round of the 2013 draft. The heavy workload has allowed him only 4.5 targets per game. Williams finished his first three years as a top-52 fantasy receiver but fell to 63rd in Year 1 of the Dak Prescott era. He failed to post a single top-10 fantasy week for the first time in his career and managed only two top-30 weeks. Williams has ranked in the top eight at the position in yards per target during three of his four seasons. Williams signed a four-year extension during the offseason, but he simply doesn't see enough volume to allow consistent fantasy production. "
Jerick McKinnon,"McKinnon is already a quality pass-catching back, but he's an A-plus athlete who averaged 4.9 YPC before a brutal 2016 campaign that can, at least partially, be blamed on brutal play from the offensive line. Of course, McKinnon's fantasy value took a major hit when Minnesota spent a second-round pick on Dalvin Cook during April's draft. McKinnon will get some work as a change-of-pace and passing-down back, but he'll struggle for volume with Cook and Latavius Murray in the mix. The 24-year-old is only worth a late-round flier in PPR leagues."
Brian Hoyer,"Say what you want about Hoyer's inconsistent and erratic play, but he was relatively effective on 200 attempts with Chicago last season. Hoyer threw six TDs and no picks and completed 67 percent of his passes (eighth best). In fact, during the past two seasons, Hoyer has thrown 25 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 569 attempts. He hasn't played enough to generate consistent fantasy production, but he did average an 11th-place weekly finish during four full games last season. Hoyer is the favorite to be under center for San Francisco come Week 1, but the leash will be short and the supporting cast is not very good."
Alex Smith,"The face of conservative quarterback play, Smith has been among the bottom five in average depth of throw during each of the past eight seasons. That includes a 6.7 mark in 2016 that was higher than only Sam Bradford's. Smith's conservative play leads to high completion percentages, low interception totals and lots of post-catch help, but it also severely limits his fantasy production. Smith has never finished a season better than 13th at the position in fantasy points and was 22nd in 2016. Those in two-quarterback leagues shouldn't ignore Smith's shaky durability; he's missed at least one game during four of the past five years. Smith is a fringe QB2 with little upside, and whose leash is shorter than ever after the team traded up to select Patrick Mahomes in April's draft."
Charles Clay,"Clay has finished as a top-18 fantasy tight end each of the past four seasons, but, in three years with the Bills, he simply hasn't been able to match his best season ' an eighth-place finish with Miami in 2013. Durability (six missed games) and drops (a position-high seven last season) are among the culprits. Clay didn't post a single top-12 fantasy week prior to three straight top-six outings during Weeks 14-16 last season. When active, Clay has been on the field for 88 percent of the Bills' snaps and handled 21 percent of the targets in each of the past two seasons. Those are huge numbers for any tight end, though he's a candidate for a reduced role in Buffalo's new-look, Rick Dennison-led offense."
Tyler Higbee,"Higbee was the Rams' fourth-round pick last season, and the 6-foot-6, 249-pound Kentucky product is now atop the depth chart following the offseason release of Lance Kendricks. The Rams' quarterback struggles limited Higbee to a 41 percent catch rate as a rookie, but 37 percent of balls thrown his way were off target. Higbee's huge frame is obviously appealing, but he's also a good athlete who can produce with the ball in his hands. He scored eight touchdowns in nine games and caught 78 percent of his targets during his final year at Kentucky. Higbee is a candidate for a second-year leap, but he'll need to fend off rookie Gerald Everett and a big step forward from Jared Goff in order to gain fantasy relevance."
O.J. Howard,"The Buccaneers picked Howard with the No. 19 pick of the draft, making him the first tight end to be selected in the first round of the draft since Eric Ebron (2014). Howard is 22 years old and sports a 6-foot-6, 251-pound frame. The Alabama star dominated the combine, running a 4.51 40-yard dash and posting the quickest times at the position in the three-cone, short shuttle and 60-yard shuttle. Howard underwhelmed statistically while undertargeted during his FBS tenure, but his elite athleticism and ability to contribute as both a receiver and blocker make him the position's top prospect in several years. Tight ends rarely offer much as a rookies, but Howard's terrific blocking ability and the Bucs' need for playmakers makes him a possible exception. He's worth a late-round flier."
Jesse James,"Following the release of Ladarius Green, James is positioned as the Steelers clear No. 1 tight end. The 6-foot-7 Penn State product is unlikely to see big target totals, but he'll see plenty of work near the goal line. He's a sneaky TE2 target."
Jeremy Kerley,"Kerley was on three different rosters last offseason but still managed to see the field on more than three-quarters of the 49ers' offensive snaps. He handled 24 percent of San Francisco's targets, but his role as a short-area target allowed him only three top-30 fantasy weeks. The team's quarterback woes helped Kerley to a 6.0 yards-per-target average (ninth lowest) and 57 percent catch rate, which is extremely low when you consider his 8.3 average depth of target (16th lowest). Kerley couldn't crack the top 50 fantasy receivers playing a massive role and is unlikely to see as much work in Kyle Shanahan's offense. He's worth only a late look in PPR leagues."
Steelers D/ST,"Pittsburgh used to sport one of the league's most-intimidating defenses, but has settled in as a mid-pack unit in recent years. That goes for its D/ST, as well, which has finished a season better than 10th in fantasy points once since 2010. The Steelers allowed the 10th-most points (327) and ranked no better than seventh in any fantasy-relevant category last season. They didn't experience much offseason turnover, but Lawrence Timmons and Jarvis Jones are gone from a pedestrian linebacker group. Stephon Tuitt, Ryan Shazier, Ross Cockrell, Mike Mitchell and Bud Dupree lead a unit without many standouts."
David Njoku,"Njoku was scooped up by Cleveland with the No. 29 overall pick in April's draft. The Miami product has massive upside as a pass-catcher and is only 20 years old. Njoku (6-foot-4, 246 pounds, 35.25-inch arms) is an exceptional athlete, he's fast, and he can line up all over the field. He averaged 11.2 yards after the catch last season. Granted, he's raw and has struggled a bit with drops, but Njoku's youth, athleticism and receiving ability provides him with a massive fantasy ceiling. Of course, considering the Browns' question marks at the quarterback position, we may need to wait a while for Njoku to flourish. He's worth no more than a late-round flier in 2017 leagues."
Austin Seferian-Jenkins,"Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey has retired, which means the days of the Jets trotting out four wide receivers on half of their pass plays are over (the NFL average in this category is 6 percent). Seferian-Jenkins' career has been marred by injury and off-field incidents. He played only 183 snaps and caught 13 passes in 2016. On the plus side, he's a freak athlete and former second-round pick who is only 24 years old and currently the team's top pass-catching option at the position. On the other hand, he's suspended for the first two games this season. The offseason reports on Seferian-Jenkins are overly positive, as he's lost weight and quit drinking - a problem he admitted was holding him down. He's worth a late-round heave in two-tight end leagues."
Brandon LaFell,"The Bengals re-signed LaFell after he was on the field for a whopping 97 percent of the team's pass plays last season. He was targeted 103 times on the year, although he averaged 5.1 per game during the nine games A.J. Green was healthy and 8.1 per game during the seven Green was out. LaFell ended up 33rd at the position in fantasy points and 15th in end zone targets (11). Of course, with Green and Tyler Eifert healthy, speedster John Ross in the mix and Tyler Boyd entering his second year, LaFell is an obvious candidate for a significantly reduced role. The 30-year-old is barely worth late-round consideration in fantasy drafts."
Phillip Dorsett,"Dorsett was a first-round pick in 2015, but the speedster out of Miami has yet to consistently show off his explosiveness at the NFL level. Undersized at 5-foot-10, 185 pounds, Dorsett has already missed six games due to injury and has scored three touchdowns in two years. His 16.0 yards per reception was ninth highest last year, but 3.9 targets per game simply isn't going to cut it. Dorsett is already behind T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief and will now need to fend off Kamar Aiken for No. 3 duties. There's year-three breakout potential, but Dorsett is no more than a late-round flier. Upgrade him in non-PPR."
Chris Ivory,"Ivory's first year with the Jaguars didn't go anywhere close to as planned. Jacksonville signed him to a five-year, $32 million contract following a career year in which he racked up 1,287 yards and 8 touchdowns on 277 touches for the Jets. In 2016, Ivory was limited by various injuries to 11 games. He averaged 3.8 YPC and found the end zone three times. Ivory is now 29 years old, and will be limited to nothing more than the occasional carry or two behind 2017 fourth-overall pick Leonard Fournette. Even if Fournette misses time, Ivory will share snaps with T.J. Yeldon and Corey Grant."
Wendell Smallwood,"Smallwood appeared in 13 games after being selected by Philadelphia in the fifth round of last year's draft. The quick and agile scatback played relatively well on 83 touches while sharing snaps with Ryan Mathews, Darren Sproles and Kenjon Barner. The Eagles did very little to address the running back position during the offseason, which leaves Smallwood as the favorite for early-down duties, with Sproles and Donnel Pumphrey positioned as passing-down and change-of-pace options. Smallwood is a sneaky flex target, especially in non-PPR formats."
Jared Goff,"Goff was the first overall pick in last year's draft, but he sure didn't look the part during the seven games he appeared in as a rookie. The Cal product completed 55 percent of his passes (third lowest), was off target 19.5 percent of the time (eighth worst) and averaged a brutal 5.3 yards per attempt (worst). That doesn't paint a pretty picture, but it's also not a death sentence (Derek Carr posted similar numbers as a rookie in 2014). There's still reason for optimism here, as Goff is only 22 years old, but considering Los Angeles' shaky offensive line and unproven group of receivers, it may take some time for him to emerge. Goff is well off the 2017 fantasy radar."
Trevor Siemian,"Replacing future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning is no easy task, but Siemian held down the fort about as well as could be expected for a seventh-round pick entering his second season. Siemian completed only 59 percent of his passes (ninth lowest), but his 8.8 average depth of throw was 11th highest. He tossed 18 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Siemian didn't sport much fantasy appeal (three top-10 weeks) and will need to fend off 2016 first-round pick Paxton Lynch in order to retain Denver's starting gig this season."
Deshaun Watson,"The Texans addressed their quarterback woes by trading up and selecting Watson in April's draft. Watson was the man under center for the 2016 national champion Clemson Tigers. He's only 21 years old and stands 6-foot-2, 221 pounds. Watson is an outstanding athlete and sports terrific arm strength, but accuracy is a concern. He tossed 41 touchdowns and ran for nine more last season, but he was picked off 17 times. Watson adds a ton of value with his legs and has a ton of pedigree and upside. With only Tom Savage in his way, Watson is the best bet among rookie passers to start Week 1. He's a sneaky bet for early QB2 value."
Mike Glennon,"The Bears signed Glennon to a three-year, $45 million contract and hope that he'll provide a competent bridge to Mitch Trubisky, whom they selected second overall in April's draft. Glennon was busy during his first two seasons in the league, but has played just 14 snaps (all last season) since the Bucs selected Jameis Winston in the 2015 draft. Glennon has a solid 29-to-15 TD/INT mark in his career and his poor 6.5 yards per attempt can be traced to his teammates averaging a league-low 3.5 yards after the catch in both 2013 and 2014. Even if Glennon is a capable starter, his most likely outcome is that of a game manager in a run-first, low-volume offense."
DeShone Kizer,"Kizer is mobile and has a very good arm, but he struggles with accuracy and decision-making. He was off target on a massive 14.5 percent of his throws last season, which is easily worst among all quarterbacks who attended the combine. Granted, he threw downfield more often, but his 59 percent completion rate is concerning. Kizer is the biggest (6-foot-4, 233 pounds) and youngest (turned 21 in January) among this year's incoming rookie quarterbacks, but he's a raw talent who ideally would spend most of his rookie season with the clipboard. Of course, Cleveland's uncertain quarterback situation likely means he'll make several starts in 2017. The second-round pick is unlikely to provide much fantasy value in 2017."
Eli Rogers,"Rogers went undrafted in 2015, but he generated some hype during the 2016 offseason when he won the team's starting slot receiver gig. Rogers missed three games due to injury but ended up catching 48 of 65 targets for 594 yards and three touchdowns. During the nine weeks he was on the field for at least three-quarters of the team's pass plays, Rogers averaged 5.7 targets per game. Rogers is entering his prime at age 24 and is the heavy favorite to enter 2017 as the team's slot man. Of course, with Antonio Brown, Le'Veon Bell, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Martavis Bryant in the mix, Rogers may struggle for consistent targets. For now, he's best viewed as a late-round PPR target."
Kenyan Drake,"Drake was a somewhat surprising third-round selection in the 2016 draft. The scat back out of Alabama projects as a change-of-pace and passing-down specialist at the NFL level, which makes him a good fit as a complement to Jay Ajayi in Miami. Drake was limited to 42 touches for 225 yards as a rookie but did average a healthy 5.4 YPC in that small sample. Drake figures to play an expanded role this season, but his reps will be limited by the presence of Ajayi and Damien Williams."
Adam Humphries,"Despite the Bucs adding DeSean Jackson and O.J. Howard, the 23-year-old Humphries remains a candidate for a third-year leap as the team's slot receiver. Even while Vincent Jackson was active, Humphries played a significant role and ended up on the field for 70.6 percent of the team's pass plays in 2016. He was limited to 5.6 targets per game, which allowed him 56 receptions for 648 yards and three touchdowns. He managed four top-30 fantasy weeks and finished the year 56th at the position. Humphries' upside is obviously capped by his role (his 5.6-yard average depth of target was second lowest among wide receivers), but he's a name to keep in mind late in PPR drafts."
Rams D/ST,"The Rams' D/ST finished top-12 from 2012-15, but collapsed to 23rd last season. They ranked 22nd in forced fumbles (12), 24th in sacks (31) and tied for 19th in D/ST touchdowns (one) after ranking in the upper-half of the league in all three categories the previous three seasons. On the plus side, they ranked top-eight in tackles for loss (102) for the seventh consecutive season. Connor Barwin, Nickell Robey-Coleman and Kayvon Webster were far from spectacular offseason acquisitions, but T.J. McDonald is gone to Miami. Aaron Donald is one of the game's best players, but he needs more help behind him."
